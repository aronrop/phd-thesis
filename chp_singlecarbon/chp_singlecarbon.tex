\section{Introduction}

Natural product total synthesis
often provides the impetus for developing new organic methodologies and can
function as a proving ground for evaluating the utility of existing synthetic
tools.\footnote{For a review on the impact of total synthesis on the
field of organic chemistry see: \frenchspacing{Nicolaou, K. C.; Vourloumis, D.;

of the Twenty-First Century. \textit{Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.} \textbf{2000},
\textit{39}, 44-122.}} Our group recently disclosed methodology for catalytic
and regioselective single carbon ring expansion of $\alpha$,$\alpha$-substituted
cyclobutanones with
trimethylsilyldiazomethane.\footnote{\frenchspacing{Dabrowski, J. A.; Moebius,

\label{ref:cdabrowski}} To prove the generality of our new mild and catalytic approach, we aimed to
apply this strategic ring expansion reaction in the context of natural product synthesis. Several biologically active sesquiterpenoid quinone natural products
bearing a \textit{cis}-fused decalin core were selected, and we set out with the
intent of developing a general strategy to access the \textit{cis}-decalin
carbon framework common to the avarane\footnote{(a) \frenchspacing{Marcos, I.

route in which the pendant aryl group could be tuned, a number of different natural products and
their analogs could be accessed through single carbon homologation of a cyclopentanone intermediate
(\ref{cmp:baa}\ce{->}\ref{cmp:bab}).

 This chapter will discuss progress made towards sesquiterpene
 quinone natural products with an emphasis on ring expansion methodology development.
 Improvements have been
made to our original reaction conditions for cyclobutanones, such that the
arguably more challenging cyclopentanone\footnote{The order of reactivity for
the ring expansion of cycloalkanones with diazomethane based on literature

substrates are now readily homologated to the corresponding cyclohexanones with high yields and
regioselectivities. Methods developed in our group showcase the first examples
of catalytic ring expansions with trimethylsilyldiazomethane and
represent a significant improvement over existing protocols. A history of previous
single carbon homologation methods with diazoalkanes was presented in chapter \ref{chp:diazobkg}.
Examples of diazoalkane-based single carbon homologation in complex molecule synthesis are presented
in the section that follows.

 \section{Diazoalkane Single Carbon Homologation in Complex
Molecules}
Single-carbon ring expansion is a powerful synthetic disconnection and has been
successfully implemented in a number of complex molecule syntheses. As discussed in Chapter
\ref{chp:diazobkg}, diazoalkane based ring expansions have made significant advances over the years.
More recent methodologies, based on the findings of Shioiri\footnote{{\frenchspacing Hashimoto, N.;

and Yamamoto,\footnote{(a)

Org. Chem.} \textbf{1994}, \textit{59}, 4725-4726.} \label{ref:cyamamoto}} have made their way into
the total syntheses of several natural and synthetic biologically active complex molecules. Chemists will often construct or purchase
the lower homologue of a ring system, utilize known methods to build up
complexity, and then implement a key ring expansion event to access the target ring size. In the
section that follows, several examples of sucessful single-carbon homologation
in the context of complex substrates will be presented. 

Polycyclic ether marine natural products, especially those belonging to
the brevotoxin family, have been linked to
cases of neurotoxic shellfish poising.\footnote{\frenchspacing{Watkins, S. M.;
Reich, A.; Fleming, L. E.; Hammond, R. Neurotoxic Shellfish Poisoning. \textit{Mar. Drugs.} \textbf{2008},
\textit{6}, 431-55.}} The discovery of these molecules and their
corresponding biological effects lead to the development of new synthetic
strategies to access the \textit{trans}-fused 6-- to 9-membered polycyclic ether
framework common to these natural products.\footnote{\frenchspacing{Nicolaou, K. C.; Yang, Z.; Shi, G.;
Gunzner, J. L.; Agrios, K. A.; G\"artner, P. Total Synthesis of Brevetoxin A.
\textit{Nature.} \textbf{1998}, \textit{392}, 264-269.}} In 1997, Mori and
coworkers published a strategy based on iterative ring expansion of the corresponding 6-membered lower homologue to access 7-membered oxepane rings.\footnote{(a) \frenchspacing{Mori, Y.; Yaegashi, K.; Furukawa, H.

\ref{cmp:baq}. The highest yields and regioselectivites were observed with the
Shioiri\crossref{ref:cshioiri} conditions at $-$78~\degc~(entry 4). Preferential
migration of the anticipated less substituted bond, followed by 1,3-Brook
rearrangement\footnote{{\frenchspacing Brook, A. G. Some Molecular Rearrangements of Organosilicon
Compounds. \textit{Acc. Chem. Res.} \textbf{1974}, \textit{7}, 77-84.} \label{ref:cbrook}} yielded
\ref{cmp:bar}, which was deprotected with PPTS to afford the target oxepane \ref{cmp:bas} in 76\%
yield over two steps.\footnote{For a more complete discussion of regioselectivity preferences see Chapter \ref{chp:diazobkg}.} \begin{table}[t] \centering

Satisfied with these model
studies, Mori utilized this ring expansion strategy in a formal synthesis of
hemibrevetoxin B (\refscheme{mori}). Lewis acid mediated ring
closure of \ref{cmp:bat} and deoxygenation afforded cyclohexanone homologation
substrate \ref{cmp:bau}. Single carbon ring expansion under highly optimized
conditions yielded the first 7-membered ether \ref{cmp:bav} in a 67\% yield.
After a series of manipulations, \ref{cmp:baw} was obtained and subsequently
homologated to introduce the second 7-membered ring. Mori was able to
sucessfully implement two regioselective single-carbon ring expansion events and
secure intermediate \ref{cmp:bax}, which could then be elaborated to the target
product (\ce{->}\ref{cmp:bay}).

In Pazos' 2009 synthesis of isolaurepan, a similar homologation strategy was
employed to produce the oxepane ring system found in the desired target
(\refscheme{pazos}).\footnote{\frenchspacing{Pazos, G.; P\'erez, M.

\textit{Tetrahedron Lett.} \textbf{2009}, \textit{50}, 5285-5287.}} Treatment of
$\alpha$-tertiary substituted cyclohexanone \ref{cmp:bbk} with \ce{BF3.Et2O} and
TMSD afforded cycloheptanone \ref{cmp:bbl} in a respectable 60\% isolated yield.
Again, preferential migration of the less substituted carbon atom was observed
to deliver a 7.5:1 mixture of regioisomers. The late stage homologation product
\ref{cmp:bbl} was then advanced to the target isolaurepan (\ref{cmp:bbm}) with
four additional steps.

% The migratory apptitudes observed in the aforementioned syntheses follow
% a pattern that is distinct from those observed in the classic Baeyer-Villager
% reaction. In the Baeyer-Villager reaction, migration of the more substituted carbon
% substitutent is typically observed.\footnote{(a) \frenchspacing{﻿Doering, W.

% \textit{39}, 2851-2855.}} This observation is rationalized by
% disposing the substrate such that the peracid bond is oriented antiperiplanar to
% the larger substituent. This effect has also been attributed to the ability of
% the migrating group to stabilize a buildup of partial positive charge in the
% transition state. The regiochemical outcome in these
% two syntheses was however, not unprecedented. Both
% Gutsche\crossref{ref:gutschetwo} and Shioiri\crossref{ref:shioiri} demonstrated
% that the less substituted bond migrates preferentially with diazomethane and
% TMSD. Greene\crossref{ref:greene} had previously demonstrated that
% $\alpha$,$\alpha$-dichlorocyclobutanones show a preference for migration of the

In Seto's synthesis of 6a-carbabrassinolide, a regioselective ring expansion
facilitated concise access to the target steroid derivative
(\refscheme{seto}).\footnote{\frenchspacing{Seto, H.; Fujioka, S.;

prevents formation of methyl ethers by O-H insertion. Seto proposes that the
diazoalkane adds to place the bulky TMS group away from the ring fusion and with
the proton oriented inside of the ring system (\ref{cmp:bbb}). This simple
model, based on minimization of steric interactions, correctly predicts the
regiochemical outcome in the previous two examples as well. Seto obtains the desired
heptanone in 11:1 regioselectivity and an excellent 80\% yield. Base-mediated
global acetate deprotection delivered 6a-carbabrassinolide (\ref{cmp:bbc}). 


In Smalley's approach to the novel antiviral compound TAK-779 (\refscheme{smalley}), a decagram
scale highly regioselective single carbon ring expansion was employed to form the crucial benzofused
7-membered carbocycle.\footnote{\frenchspacing{Smalley, T. L. A Ring Expansion Strategy in Antiviral
Synthesis: A Novel Approach to TAK-779. \textit{Synthetic Commun.} \textbf{2004}, \textit{34},
1973-1980.}} Starting from inexpensive and commercially available 7-methoxy-1-tetralone
(\ref{cmp:bbd}), biaryl tetralone \ref{cmp:bbe} was quickly accessed through a three step sequence. 
Ring expansion with \ce{BF3.Et2O} and TMSD afforded the desired suberone \ref{cmp:bbf} in multi-gram
quantities as a single regioisomer by $^1$H NMR spectroscopy. The high preference for migration of the aryl bond can be rationalized by an electronic orbital overlap
argument. Diazoalkane insertion reactions with aldehydes typically afford ketone products, formed by
preferential migration of the carbonyl C-H bond.\footnote{For a lead reference on
aldehyde homologations with diazoalkanes see: {\frenchspacing Wommack, A. J.; Moebius, D. C.;
Travis, A. L.; Kingsbury, J. S. Diverse Alkanones by Catalytic Carbon Insertion into the Formyl C-H
Bond. Concise Access to the Natural Precursor of Achyrofuran. \textit{Org. Lett.} \textbf{2009},
\textit{11}, 3202-3205.}} The spherical, non-directional nature of the hydrogen \textit{s} orbital
allows for facile migration. In Smalley's example, the migrating carbon center is sp$^2$ hybridized,
resulting in a less directional orbital that can overlap more readily with the \ce{C-N} $\sigma^*$
orbital. This migration preference was also consistent with a previous report by House that showed a
strong preference for phenyl versus alkyl migration with diazomethane and
\ce{BF3.Et2O}.\footnote{See Table \ref{tbl:housereg} on page \pageref{tbl:housereg} and:

completed in 5 additional steps, providing scalable access to TAK-779 (\ref{cmp:bbg}).

The reaction of diazomethane with $\alpha$,$\beta$-unsaturated carbonyl compounds under classical
protic conditions has been shown to produce pyrazoline products arising from 1,3-dipolar
cycloaddtions.\footnote{See reference \ref{ref:cgutsche} for further details.\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{chp_singlecarbon/images/alphabetaunsat}} Limited examples of
$\alpha$,$\beta$-unsaturated carbonyl substrates undergoing ring expansion in the presence of Lewis
acid catalysts have been reported. It was not until the introduction of
Lewis acids for diazoalkane ring expansion that these types of substrates
were accessible.\footnote{{\frenchspacing Johnson, W.

In arguably one of the most challenging single
carbon homologations to date, the Snyder group attempted to
homologate an exceptionally crowded $\alpha$,$\alpha'$-disubstituted
cyclohexanone during their synthesis of
Rippertenol (\refscheme{snyder}).\footnote{\frenchspacing{Snyder,

8850-8853.}} A Lewis acid mediated inverse demand Diels-Alder reaction between
electron deficient diene \ref{cmp:bbn} and ketene acetal \ref{cmp:bbo} afforded
the carbon framework of the six membered ring (\ce{->}\ref{cmp:bbp}) that would later
be subjected to single carbon homologation. Two further steps, Lombardo-Takai
olefination with an acidic workup and hydrogenation, unmasked the ketone for ring
expansion (\ref{cmp:bbp} \ce{->} \ref{cmp:bbq}). Extensive screening lead to modified
Shioiri\crossref{ref:cshioiri} conditions as the optimium means to obtain
cycloheptanone \ref{cmp:bbr}, although it was only recovered in 21\% yield under
highly optimized conditions. The regiochemical outcome was not anticipated,
however, it was of little consequence as the ketone was removed in subsequent
steps. To avoid epimerization of the adjacent methyl stereocenter, a two-step
reduction radical deoxgenation strategy followed by silyl deprotection delivered
the target natural product \ref{cmp:bbs}. 

The Synder synthesis of rippertenol and other examples that have been presented
illustrate a need for more mild and catalytic methods to accomplish single
carbon ring expansions. Although a number of the syntheses showcase successful
and high yielding ring expansions, none of the examples are catalytic. The
sections that follow will detail our work to develop and successfully implement
the first mild and catalytic ring expansion methodology in the context of
complex molecule synthesis.

\section{Model Optimization Studies for Cyclopentanone Ring Expansions}
\label{sec:modeloptimization}

Previous studies from our group on scandium catalyzed single carbon ring expansion were focused
on $\alpha$-quaternary cyclobutanones,\crossref{ref:cdabrowski} and we were intent
on utilizing this methodology in the context of an advanced $\alpha$-quaternary substituted
cyclopentanone intermediate. We therefore chose to concentrate our
studies first on a suitable model system, 2-methyl-2-phenyl cyclopentanone (\ref{cmp:meph}), which
was prepared on gram scale by methods developed in our group for substituted carbon insertion.\footnote{See Chapter \ref{chp:asymmetric} for experimental details. \\

\end{table}
To establish a benchmark for our testing, we first evaluated the efficacy of the
Shioiri\crossref{ref:cshioiri} conditions (Table \ref{tbl:comparison}, entry 1).
We were surprised to see such high levels of regiocontrol with good yields of
the desired cyclohexanone \ref{cmp:xbac}. We then tested
Yamamoto's\crossref{ref:cyamamoto} conditions, which resulted in substantially
lower conversion and a poor yield of the desired product (entry 2). The Shioiri
conditions worked well in this context, but regardless required
superstoichiometric amounts of \ce{BF3.Et2O} to achieve high levels of
conversion. For this model substrate 1.5 equivalents was sufficient, but some
of the previously mentioned studies on more complex molecules required more than 4 equivalents. The
presence of Lewis basic functional groups other than the target ketone can interact with the Lewis
acid promoter and shut down the reaction. 

We then attempted to translate the previously reported conditions to our model
cyclopentanone substrate. Initial attempts resulted in highly irreproducible
reactions, rarely affording complete conversion. Even two identical reactions
run side by side under presumably the same conditions gave dramatically
different outcomes. Occasionally, reactions were successful, giving hope that
we could discover or control all the variables to produce a more reliable
reaction profile. We decided to approach the problem in two directions: (1) control all the
environmental variables by running with freshly purified reagents under dry conditions in a glove box, (2) monitor the reaction progress with an advanced analytical
technique to obtain the maximum possible information. 

Attempts to use ReactIR to monitor the reaction did not generate any usable data
and was operationally difficult to set up rigorously anhydrous reactions. ReactIR was abandoned
quickly in favor of $^1$H NMR spectroscopy, which proved to be operationally simpler and provided better
quality data. Reactions could be set up in a glove box and transferred to a J-Young tube
for analysis. In a glove box, rigorously vacuum dried \ce{Sc(OTf)3} was combined with cyclopentanone 
\ref{cmp:meph} in \ce{CDCl3} and allowed to stir for 15 minutes before adding 1.5 equivalents of
TMSD. The heterogeneous yellow reaction mixture was transferred to a J-Young NMR
tube, where a slow stream of nitrogen gas evolution began. $^1$H NMR data were recorded at
30 minute intervals and showed complete conversion after 450 minutes (7.5 hours)
at room temperature. After an additional 8 hours, no further
change was observed in the spectrum, and the mixture was then subjected to a dilute
acid hydrolysis. The products of the reaction were primarily
\ref{cmp:xbac} and \ref{cmp:xbad} in an 8:1 ratio by $^1$H NMR
spectroscopy. This promising result was promptly repeated with an identical
setup and gratifyingly afforded identical results.

With these two successful reactions, we still needed to determine the cause of
the previously irreproducible reactions. When the reactions were worked
up, they were first rinsed into a separatory funnel with benchtop \ce{Et2O}, which
immediately caused the rapid destruction of any remaining diazoalkane. We had
also observed that monitoring the reaction progress by thin layer chromatography
in certain cases also destroyed the diazoalkane. Trace amounts of water were
previously found to have a profound impact on both reaction kinetics and selectivity for asymmetric ring expansion reactions with chiral scandium catalysts.\footnote{\frenchspacing{Rendina, V. L.; Moebius, D. C.; Kingsbury, J. S. An Enantioselective Synthesis of 2-Aryl Cycloalkanones by Sc-Catalyzed Carbon Insertion. \textit{Org. Lett.}
\textbf{2011}, \textit{13}, 2004-2007.}} We rationalized that trace amounts of
water present in any of the reaction components, or adventitious atmospheric
water, may have been responsible for the inconsistent reactivity. An experiment was carried out to
test this hypothesis. When TMSD was mixed with 5 equivalents of water, an insignificant change in
the concentration\footnote{Determined by $^1$H NMR spectroscopy with
1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene as an internal standard.} was observed after 24
hours at room temperature. The same experiment with TMSD and 10 mol
\% \ce{Sc(OTf)3} also showed minimal change,\footnote{This result was
somewhat surprising given that Lewis acids are known to promote the
decomposition of diazoalkanes. See reference \ref{ref:cyamamoto}a and references
within.} but when an equivalent of water was added the diazoalkane began to
rapidly decompose (Figure \ref{fig:decompgraph}). In less than 20 minutes, half of the original
diazoalkane had been destroyed. The proposed pathway of decomposition is illustrated in Scheme
\ref{sch:scwatereq}.
Although \ce{Sc(OTf)3} is a water tolerant Lewis acid and is prepared from aqueous
triflic acid,\footnote{\frenchspacing{Kobayashi, S.; Hachiya, I.; Araki,
M.; Ishitani, H. Scandium Trifluoromethanesulfonate (Sc(OTf)$_3$). A Novel
Reusable Catalyst in the Diels-Alder Reaction. \textit{Tetrahedron Lett.}
\textbf{1993}, \textit{34}, 3755-3758.}} presumably an equilibrium can be
established with water which generates small quantities of acid.\footnote{{\frenchspacing Kobayashi,

Constants for Substitution of Inner-Sphere Water Ligands. \textit{J. Am. Chem. Soc.} \textbf{1998},
\textit{120}, 8287-8288.}}  Br{\o}nsted acids
have long been known to facilitate rapid decomposition of diazoalkanes, first by
protonation and then by subsequent substitution with the conjugate base or an
appropriate nucleophile.\footnote{For a lead reference on the reaction of diazoalkanes with acids

Solutions by Fluorine NMR. \textit{J. Org. Chem.} \textbf{2012}, \textit{77}, 1181-1185.}} In this
case, water displaces nitrogen followed by a proton transfer to regenerate the Br{\o}nsted acid.
Trimethylsilyl methanol (\ref{cmp:bbt}) was not observed by $^1$H NMR
spectroscopy, instead a 1,2-Brook rearrangement\crossref{ref:cbrook} likely occurred to produce
methoxytrimethylsilane (\ce{->}\ref{cmp:bbu}).

With a reliable reaction protocol in hand, we began to evaluate other variables
to discover an optimized set of conditions. We first investigated other scandium
(III) salts and several other lanthanide triflates to ensure that we were
optimizing the best catalyst. Results of the catalyst screen are summarized in
\reftable{catscreen}. The highest yield of the major regioisomer
\ref{cmp:xbac} was obtained with \ce{Sc(OTf)3} (entry 1). Other less
Lewis acidic scandium salts (entries 2--5) resulted in lower levels of
conversion with comparable levels of regiocontrol. We were intrigued by the high
levels of regiocontrol observed with \ce{Yb(OTf)3} (entry 7). This less potent
and larger Lewis acid may enforce a more selective initial addition of the
diazoalkane, leading to the substantially higher regioselectivity. Later
attempts to use the stronger Lewis acid \ce{Yb(NTf2)3} to increase reaction
conversion resulted in rapid decomposition of the diazoalkane and low
conversion to the homologated products. We decided to continue optimizing
\ce{Sc(OTf)3} because of its higher activity and the ease that reactions could
be monitored by $^1$H NMR spectroscopy. Ytterbium (III) salts are paramagnetic
and complicated monitoring by NMR.

Table \ref{tbl:solventscreen} shows the results of a solvent screen with
catalytic \ce{Sc(OTf)3}. Entries 1--4 all showed high levels of conversion and
similar levels of regiocontrol, despite significant differences in polarity.
Even hexanes (entry 4), where the catalyst was completely heterogeneous,
proceeded to high conversion. Running in ethereal or Lewis basic solvents
(entries 5--7) not surprisingly supressed catalyst efficiency.\footnote{A similar observation was
made by Shioiri when using \ce{BF3.Et2O} as a promoter. Methylene chloride was selected as the
optimum solvent. See reference \ref{ref:cshioiri} for details.} The higher regiocontrol observed in
\ce{Et2O} suggested that filling the coordination sphere around scandium may produce a more selective catalyst. A single experiment examining regioselectivity as a function of conversion seemed to
indicate that binding of the product silyl enol ether resulted in higher
selectivity as the reaction progressed. The large discrepancy between conversion
and yield in \ce{CH3CN} (entry 7) was determined to be the result of
overhomologation to produce the cycloheptanone.


With a successful preliminary result (Table \ref{tbl:catscreen}, entry 1, page
\pageref{tbl:catscreen}), we still wanted to see if the yield of the major regioisomer could be
enhanced by increasing the regioisomeric ratio. We prepared the sterically more demanding
phenyldimethylsilyldiazomethane\footnote{\frenchspacing{Shioiri, T.;
Aoyama, T.; Mori, S. Trimethylsilyldiazomethane. \textit{Org. Synth.}
\textbf{1990}, \textit{68}, 1.} \label{ref:bshioriorgsynth}} (\ref{cmp:bbv}, \refscheme{pdmsd}) and
rationalized that higher levels of regioselectivity would be observed based on the preference for the
diazoalkane to add such that the bulky silicon group would be oriented away from
the more substituted side of the ketone. The intermediate \ref{cmp:bbw} avoids
this costly steric interaction and leads to the observed major regioisomer
\ref{cmp:xbac} in $>$15:1 selectivity, doubling the previously observed
selectivity with TMSD. For simpler model substrates, employing \ref{cmp:bbv} could provide
access to an easily isolable and synthetically useful more stable silyl enol ether with high
levels of regiocontrol.

Pleased with the performance of the \ce{Sc(OTf)3} TMSD system
thus far, we did not want to spend excessive time optimizing model substrate
\ref{cmp:meph}. Our synthetic strategy would ultimately involve homologation of
a \textit{cis}-fused 6,5-ring system (\refscheme{strategydecalin}, page
\pageref{sch:strategydecalin}), and we wanted to evaluate a more representative model. Commercially
available estrone 3-methyl ether (\ref{cmp:bby}) was subjected to two equivalents of TMSD and 5 mol \% \ce{Sc(OTf)3} in
deuterochloroform for 24 hours (\refscheme{estrone}). Complete
conversion and a 72\% yield of enol silane \ref{cmp:bbz} was observed by $^1$H NMR spectroscopy before deprotection
with TBAF. Purification by column chromatography afforded the major regioisomer
\ref{cmp:xbae} in an acceptable 68\% isolated yield along with 22\% of
\ref{cmp:xbaf}.

With all of these results and information in hand, we were ready to start
looking at more complex substrates. The following section will discuss our
progress towards several sesquiterpene quinone natural products, with a focus on
the key ring expansion step.

\section{Application to the Total Synthesis of 5-\textit{epi}-Ilimaquinone}

  \vspace{-30pt}
\end{wrapfigure}
We initially decided to concentrate our efforts on the synthesis of
5-\textit{epi}-ilimaquinone (\ref{cmp:bcf}), first isolated from the marine
sponge \textit{Fenestraspongia} by Faulkner and coworkers in
1985.\footnote{Originally isolated as a 2:3 mixture with
(--)-ilimaquinone. \frenchspacing{Cart\'e, B.; Rose, C. B.; Faulkner, D. J.
5-\textit{epi}-Ilimiquinone, a Metabolite of the Sponge \textit{Fenestraspongia} Sp.
\textit{J. Org. Chem.} \textbf{1985}, \textit{50}, 2785-2787.}} Access to
5-\textit{epi}-ilimaquinone, never prepared before by total synthesis, would
additionally faciliate access to several other related aminoquinone
derivatives. The section that follows
will discuss two synthetic generations, culminating in the successful
implementation of catalytic single carbon ring expansion through careful
experimentation and application of findings discussed in the previous section.

\subsection{First Generation Synthesis}
The retrosynthetic analysis for 5-\textit{epi}-ilimaquinone (\ref{cmp:bcf}) is
depicted in \refscheme{retrosynthesis}. We had also
originally planned to target several other natural aminoquinone derivatives
(\ref{cmp:bcc}, \ref{cmp:bcd}, \ref{cmp:bce}), which could theoretically be prepared in a single
substitution step from \ref{cmp:bcf} with the appropriate amine. A late-stage oxidation of aryl
intermediate \ref{cmp:bcg}, similar to that found in Snapper's synthesis of ($-$)-illimaquinone,
could provide the sensitive quinone moiety found in the final targets.\footnote{{\frenchspacing
Bruner, S. D.; Radeke, H. S.; Tallarico, J. A.; Snapper, M. L. Total Synthesis of (-)-Ilimaquinone.
\textit{J. Org. Chem.} \textbf{1995}, \textit{60}, 1114-1115.} \label{ref:csnapper}} Intermediate
\ref{cmp:bcg} could be accessed by olefination of \ref{cmp:bch}, which would be dervived from
\ref{cmp:xbas} following the key ring expansion event and hydrogenation to set the C-8
$\beta$-methyl stereocenter. Intermediate \ref{cmp:xbas} could be prepared from \ref{cmp:xban}
following olefination and oxidation steps. The pendant aryl group in \ref{cmp:xban} could be
attached by a dissolved metal reductive alyklation with reduced Hajos-Parrish ketone \ref{cmp:xbah} and aryl
iodide \ref{cmp:xbam}, introducing both the \textit{cis} ring junction and C-9 quaternary center.

We began by preparing reduced Hajos-Parrish ketone \ref{cmp:xbah} according to a modified literature
protocol,\footnote{See the experimental section for details. {\frenchspacing Shigehisa, H.;

\textit{61}, 5057-5065.}} which was obtained with $>$98\% ee after a single recrystallization.
Electrophile \ref{cmp:xbam} was selected because of its prior
use in the total synthesis of ($-$)-ilimaquinone by the Snapper
group.\footnote{The Snapper group utilized the corresponding aryl bromide. See reference
\ref{ref:csnapper} for details.} Starting from commercially available
3,5-dimethoxybenzoic acid (\ref{cmp:bcl}), reduction and chlorination afforded chloroalcohol \ref{cmp:xbak} (\refscheme{ephileone}). Standard bromination conditions allowed access to the benzyl bromide which was stable enough to be purified by silica gel chromatography. By employing
Finkelstein conditions, the more reactive benzyl iodide (\ref{cmp:xbam}) could be isolated cleanly
after simple filtration and concentration.

With fragments \ref{cmp:xbam} and \ref{cmp:xbah} in hand, we were prepared
to couple them in a single dissolved metal reductive alkylation step. In previous
examples, 6,6 ring systems were known to form exclusively \textit{trans} decalin
ring systems.\footnote{The stereochemical outcome of these reactions was extensively studied by
Stork. (a) {\frenchspacing Stork, G.; Darling, S. D. Stereochemistry of the Lithium-Ammonia

junction within the context of 6,5 ring systems.\footnote{Two examples are known in the literature:
(a) {\frenchspacing Paquette, L. A.; Wang, T.-Z.; Sivik, M. R. Total Synthesis of ($-$)-Austalide B.

Lhommet, G. Diastereoselective Synthesis of a Limonoid Model Related to the Insect Antifeedant
Genudin. \textit{J. Org. Chem.} \textbf{1994}, \textit{59}, 3902-3905.}} However, previous examples
in the literature did not study the diastereoselectivity in these systems when trapping an
electrophile to form an all carbon quaternary center. Exposure of \ref{cmp:xbah} to lithium metal in ammonia formed a cup-shaped enolate intermediate after protonation at the ring fusion, facilitating a substrate controlled highly diastereoselective trap of electrophile \ref{cmp:xbam} (\ce{->} \ref{cmp:xban}, \refscheme{forwardgenone}). The \textit{cis} ring
fusion and stereochemistry of the newly forged all carbon quaternary center were later unambiguously
confirmed by X-ray crystallography.
Ketoalcohol \ref{cmp:xban} was protected\footnote{Olefination of unprotected \ref{cmp:xban} resulted
recovery of an unexpected product, likely the result of an intramolecular 1,5-hydride shift. See
section \ref{sec:hydride} (page \pageref{sec:hydride}) for further details.} and olefinated to
deliver \ref{cmp:xbaq} in 76\% yield over two steps. Attempts to hydrogenate \ref{cmp:xbaq}, the
free alcohol, or ketone to set the C-8 $\beta$-methyl stereocenter were less than satisfactory with
a variety of standard heterogeneous hydrogenation catalysts. We reasoned that moving the olefin into
the ring system and farther away from the congested C-9 quaternary center could favorably affect the
outcome of further hydrogenation efforts. Rhodium mediated isomerization\footnote{{\frenchspacing

11586-11593.}} with concomitant silyl deprotection followed by PCC oxidation provided cyclopentanone
\ref{cmp:xbas} in a 91\% yield over two steps.
Hydrogenation over Adams' catalyst delivered epimeric cyclopentanones \ref{cmp:xbat} and
\ref{cmp:xbau} in an unoptimized 3:2 dr slightly favoring the desired $\beta$-methyl epimer. We
turned our attention next to the key ring expansion event with two potential cyclopentanone
substrates in hand (\ref{cmp:xbas} and \ref{cmp:xbat}).

\end{Scheme}
We were pleased to see that the conditions optimized previously for model
systems translated exceptionally well to cyclopentanone \ref{cmp:xbas} with very
little modification (\refscheme{homoone}). Exposure of \ref{cmp:xbas} to 10 mol \%
\ce{Sc(OTf)3} and 1.5 equivalents of TMSD in \ce{CDCl3} showed only 33\% conversion after 18
hours at room temperature. Simply heating the reaction mixture to 50
\degc~resulted in 88\% conversion in an additional 9 hours and complete
conversion with a further 10 hours of heating. After dilute acid hydrolysis, the
regioselectivity by $^1$H NMR spectroscopy was approximately 6:1,
favoring the desired regioisomer (\ref{cmp:xbav}). Dropping the catalyst loading to 5 mol \% and
increasing the concentration allowed the desired cyclohexanone to be recovered
in an 89\% isolated yield ($>$8:1 regioselectivity, 16 h, 50 \degc) after protodesilylation. We also
attempted to use the bulkier PDMSD with \ref{cmp:xbas}, which had previously performed better in the context of model studies (\refscheme{pdmsd}, page
\pageref{sch:pdmsd}). After heating for 24 hours at 50 \degc\  the reaction mixture was analyzed by
$^1$H NMR spectroscopy and showed a single regioisomer; however, the conversion had only reached
75\% during this time period (\ce{->} \ref{cmp:xbav}, \refscheme{homoonepdms}). The larger
diazoalkane afforded the higher levels of regioselectivity expected from model studies, but the
reaction efficiency suffered. Content with the use of TMSD, we attempted to press forward with
\ref{cmp:xbav} in hand. Unfortunately, all attempts to hydrogenate \ref{cmp:xbav} were
unsucessful.\footnote{A complete discussion of attempts to further transform \ref{cmp:xbav} and
related compounds will be included as part of the Ph.D. dissertation of Hilan Z. Kaplan.

When $\beta$-methyl cyclopentanone \ref{cmp:xbat} was subjected to similar homologation
conditions optimized above for \ref{cmp:xbas} (5 mol \% \ce{Sc(OTf)3}, 2 equivalents TMSD), we were
disappointed to see a complete lack of reactivity. Heating the reaction mixture to 50 \degc\ did nothing to drive a productive reaction,
instead simply accelerated decomposition of the diazoalkane. The starting cyclopentanone was
returned unchanged. In another experiment with 6 equivalents of TMSD, heating to 70 \degc\ lead to
complete decomposition of the diazoalkane and starting material (\refscheme{homoonebeta}). Not even
a trace amount of the characteristic enol silane \ref{cmp:bcm} could be detected. A control
experiment containing a mixture of $\beta$-- and $\alpha$-methyl cyclopentanones \ref{cmp:xbat} and \ref{cmp:xbau} was run with two equivalents of TMSD and 5 mol \% \ce{Sc(OTf)3} at 50 \degc\ 
overnight. We were able to observe complete conversion of the $\alpha$ epimer \ref{cmp:xbau} by
$^1$H NMR, but the $\beta$ epimer remained completely untouched. This control indicated that our
reaction was working properly and something particular about the $\beta$ epimer was preventing the
homologation reaction from occuring.

Looking at the solid state structure of $\beta$-methyl cyclopentanone \ref{cmp:xbat} revealed a
likely rationale for why this substrate failed to undergo homologation even under strongly forcing
conditions (\reffigure{betamethylcrystal}). Access to the $\pi$* orbital of the carbonyl was
exceptionally hindered by angular methyl groups on both sides of the molecule. The $\alpha$ face of the carbonyl was
effectively blocked by the adjacent methyl group and the $\beta$ face was shielded by the axial
methyl group on the C-9 quaternary center. The solid state structure of the $\alpha$-methyl
cyclopentanone \ref{cmp:xbau} revealed a different chair conformation where the $\beta$ face of the
carbonyl was now more accessible (\reffigure{alphamethylcrystal}).  Although the solid state structure may not
accurately represent the solution phase structure as there may be more conformational liberty in
solution, these structural features shed light on why \ref{cmp:xbau} readily underwent
homologation, whereas \ref{cmp:xbat} was completely inert.

\subsection{Second Generation Synthesis}

The first generation dissolved metal reductive alkylation (\ref{cmp:xbah} + \ref{cmp:xbam} \ce{->}
\ref{cmp:xban}, \refscheme{forwardgenone}, page \pageref{sch:forwardgenone}) and subsequent single
carbon homologation reactions with trisubstituted ene-one \ref{cmp:xbas} performed exceptionally
well. However, we ran into a number of unexpected difficulties when attempting to further transform
cyclohexanone \ref{cmp:xbav}. Installing the C-8 $\beta$-methyl stereogenic
center appeared to be an insurmountable problem.\crossref{ref:kaplancopout} In an attempt to address
these issues, a second generation route was designed. The synthetic strategy remained largely the
same for the second generation route. A dissolved metal reductive alkylation event would build a significant portion of the carbon framework and set the key
\textit{cis} ring fusion. Ring expansion with TMSD would then provide access to the decalin core
found in the final target. The major difference in the second generation was the selection of
electrophile.

  \label{sch:ephiletwo}
\end{Scheme}
We wanted to incorporate functionality into the electrophile that could be unmasked later and
provide a means to direct a homogeneous hydrogenation catalyst to the $\beta$-face of the
molecule.\footnote{{\frenchspacing Hoveyda, A.

electrophile \ref{cmp:xbay} (\refscheme{ephiletwo}), which contained an orthogonally protected

We then proceeded with the dissolved metal reductive alkylation of
electrophile \ref{cmp:xbay} and reduced Hajos-Parrish ketone \ref{cmp:xbah}. The reductive
alkylation smoothly delivered the desired keto-alcohol \ref{cmp:xbaz} in 79\% yield after column
chromatography (\refscheme{forwardgentwo}). Silyl protection under standard conditions and
Wittig olefination afforded \ref{cmp:xbbc} in 85\% yield over two steps. At this stage in the
previous generation synthesis we isomerized the 1,1-disubstituted exocyclic olefin to help
facilitate a poorly diastereoselective hydrogenation over Adam's catalyst (\refscheme{forwardgenone}, page
\pageref{sch:forwardgenone}). By diverging the material at this point and
bringing forward both the 1,1-disubstituted olefin and the trisubstituted olefin, we could have
more substrates to test in the homologation reaction and subsequent hydrogenation
(\refscheme{forwardgentwodiverge}).
Direct deprotection of \ref{cmp:xbbc} with TBAF followed by Dess-Martin oxidation provided access to
the exocyclic 1,1-disubstituted cyclopentanone \ref{cmp:xbbe} in quantitative yield over two steps.
Rhodium mediated isomerization and deprotection of \ref{cmp:xbbc} followed by Dess-Martin oxidation
afforded the trisubtituted olefin \ref{cmp:xbbg} in 98\% yield over two steps. Attempts were not
made to hydrogenate either \ref{cmp:xbbe} or \ref{cmp:xbbg} prior to the homologation event because
of our previous challenges with $\beta$-methyl cyclopentanone \ref{cmp:xbat}.

  \caption{Excellent yield with the homologation of \ref{cmp:xbbg}.}
  \label{sch:homotwotrisub}
\end{Scheme}
We then focused on the key ring expansion event with two additional cyclopentanone substrates in
hand (\ref{cmp:xbbe}, \ref{cmp:xbbg}). We were pleased again to see that both substrates readily
underwent homologation with mild warming of the reaction mixture, reaching full conversion in less
than 24 hours.
Exocyclic cyclopentanone \ref{cmp:xbbe} delivered a slightly diminished 69\% isolated yield of the desired major regioisomer
\ref{cmp:xbbh}, along with a 7\% isolated yield of the minor regioisomer \ref{cmp:xbbi}
(\refscheme{homotwoexocyclic}, approx.
7:1 rr by crude $^1$H NMR).
Isomerized cyclopentanone \ref{cmp:xbbg} afforded an excellent 93\% isolated yield of the target
homologated product \ref{cmp:xbbj} (\refscheme{homotwotrisub}). The homologation reaction of
\ref{cmp:xbbg} tracked well with the results obtained in the first generation route with \ref{cmp:xbas} (89\% isolated, $>$8:1 rr). These results
illustrate how seemingly subtle changes to the molecule can have a fairly striking effect on the
outcome of the homologation reaction.

  \caption{Modeling of cyclopentanones \ref{cmp:xbbe} and \ref{cmp:xbbg} reveals different chair

  \label{fig:homotwomodel}
\end{figure}
Modeling of cyclopentanones \ref{cmp:xbbe} and \ref{cmp:xbbg} \textit{in silico} revealed that the
position of the olefin significantly impacts the preferred chair conformation of the
molecule.\footnote{Optimized geometries were calculated with Gaussian '09 - B3LYP 3-21G / Avogadro
1.03} The endocyclic olefin cyclopentanone \ref{cmp:xbbg} (left, \reffigure{homotwomodel}) adopts a
half-chair conformation that places both the C-9 appended aryl group and $\alpha$-keto methyl in a
distorted 1,3-diaxial orientation. The exocyclic olefin cyclopentanone \ref{cmp:xbbe} (right,
\reffigure{homotwomodel}) prefers a twist-boat conformation where the C-9 aryl moiety rests in an
equatorial disposition and the $\alpha$-keto methyl remains axial. The change in conformation
translates to a modified steric environment around the ketone, which in turn affects the outcome
of the homologation reactions. 



The homologation reactions performed exceptionally well, and we were especially pleased to see that
reactions worked consistently. The reliability and scalability of the reaction allowed ample
quantities of material to be moved forward. Again significant hardships were encountered when
attempting to further transform both
\ref{cmp:xbbh} and \ref{cmp:xbbj}. A complete discussion is beyond the scope of this chapter and will be discussed elsewhere.\crossref{ref:kaplancopout}


\subsection{An Unexpected 1,5-Hydride Shift}
\label{sec:hydride}

  \caption{Unexpected molecular rearrangement during Wittig olefination.}
  \label{sch:hydrideone}
\end{Scheme}
During the course of our studies we observed an unexpected molecular rearrangement when attempting
to directly olefinate the \textit{cis}-fused keto alcohol products derived from
dissolved metal reductive alkylation.
When keto-alcohol \ref{cmp:xban} was subjected to Wittig methylenation conditions, an ene-carbinol
isomeric with the anticipated product was isolated in an 81\% yield
(\ce{->}\ref{cmp:xbao}, \refscheme{hydrideone}).
The observed product, whose connectivity was rigorously established by TOCSY NMR data, was the result of what we believed to be
a transannular 1,5-hydride migration followed by cyclo\textit{pentanone} methylenation. This type of
internal redox event has been observed previously in a number conformationally biased bicyclic
systems.\footnote{(a) {\frenchspacing Dvornik, D.; Edwards, O. E. Ajaconine: An Intramolecular

1,3 around the cyclohexanone, would suffer from a 1,3-diaxial interaction in either chair conformer. Under the
reaction conditions, a boat conformation (\ref{cmp:bco}) that helps alleviate some of the penalizing
1,3 interactions could be energetically accessible and allow the migrating hydrogen to come in close
proximity of the carbonyl $\pi$* orbital. In the second generation synthesis we also observed a similar molecular rearrangement with
unprotected keto-alcohol \ref{cmp:xbaz} (\refscheme{hydridetwo}). Instead of isolating the analogous 
rearranged ene-carbinol, further transformation of \ref{cmp:bcp} led to the unusual tetracyclic
olefin \ref{cmp:xbba} which could be recovered in a 60\% isolated yield. All analytical data were
consistent with structure \ref{cmp:xbba} and no other major products were isolated from the reaction
mixture.

\end{figure}
To test if the hydride shift occured through an intramolecular process we designed a simple
crossover experiment (\refscheme{crossover}). Subjecting a 1:1
molar mixture of \ref{cmp:xbaz} and \ref{cmp:xbbo} to Wittig conditions should result in exclusive
formation of \ref{cmp:bcq} and \ref{cmp:bcr} if the process proceeds through a clean intramolecular
reaction.
In the event that the mechanism involves a bimolecular process, the crossover products \ref{cmp:bcs}
and \ref{cmp:bct} should also be observed. We began by preparing a sample of doubly-labelled
keto-alcohol \ref{cmp:xbbo}, which required the synthesis of labelled versions of the
second generation electrophile \ref{cmp:xbay} and reduced Hajos-Parrish ketone
\ref{cmp:xbah}.\footnote{See the experimental section for details.} With the requisite material in
hand, we subjected \ref{cmp:xbaz} and \ref{cmp:xbbo} to the standard Wittig conditions. High
resolution mass spectroscopic data were then recorded on the reaction mixture
(\reffigure{crossovermass}) and confirmed that the process does indeed occur through an exclusively
intramolecular pathway. The predicted mass spectrum for
\ref{cmp:bcq} and \ref{cmp:bcr}, which accounts for the natural isotopic distribution pattern, was
identical to the experimental spectrum. The crossover product masses for \ref{cmp:bcs}
(\ce{C20H25DClO2}, 334.1679 [M+H]$^+$) and \ref{cmp:bct} (\ce{C20H24D2ClO2}, 335.1741 [M+H]$^+$)
were not detected. Although there is a mass hit in the experimental spectrum at 334.1652, the peak
corresponds to the expected [M + H + 1]$^+$ peak for \ref{cmp:bcq} and the resolution of the
instrument was high enough to distinguish between 334.1652 and 334.1679. In the event that the masses overlapped in
the spectrum, the ratio between peak heights was still in agreement with the expected natural
isotopic distribution for the intramolecular products. These
data are a nice complement to the examples in the literature, since the previously reported cases
did not thoroughly investigate the reaction mechanism.\crossref{ref:hydriderefs}

\section{Conclusion}

In summary, we have succesfully demonstrated the first examples of catalytic single-carbon
homologation with $\alpha$-quaternary cyclopentanone substrates. In model systems, high levels of
regioselectivity can be obtained by either using \ce{Yb(OTf)3} as the catalyst, or by employing the
more sterically demanding diazoalkane PDMSD (up to $>$50:1 rr). Rigorously controlling environmental
variables led to procedures that allow these reactions to be carried out reliably. The precautions
discussed in Chapter \ref{chp:asymmetric} with regard to dry reaction conditions proved to be
integral to the success of single-carbon homologations as well. When extending the method to more
complex substrates, moderate to high yields with good levels of regiocontrol were observed (69-93\% yield, $>$8:1 rr). Of the previous examples in the literature, the new reactions catalyzed by low loadings of \ce{Sc(OTf)3} were among the highest yielding and most selective. We are confident that these newly developed conditions could find other applications in the future.
