\subsection{General Information}

\subsubsection{General Procedures}
Unless stated otherwise, all reactions were carried out in flame-dried glassware under an atmosphere
of argon passed through a tower of finely powdered Drierite$\textsuperscript{\textregistered}$ in dry, degassed solvent with standard
Schlenk or vacuum-line techniques. Particularly air-sensitive manipulations were performed in an
MBraun Unilab nitrogen atmosphere glove box. Flash column chromatography, driven by compressed air,
was performed according to the procedure of Still \textit{et al.}\footnote{{\frenchspacing Still, W. C.; Kahn, M.; Mitra,
A. Rapid Chromatographic Technique for Preparative Separations with Moderate Resolution. \textit{J.
Org. Chem.} \textbf{1978}, \textit{43}, 2923-2925.}} with
ZEOPrep 60 Eco 40-63 $\mu$m silica gel. Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed using 0.25 mm
silica gel 60 F254 plates purchased from EMD Chemicals. TLC plates were visualized by exposure to ultraviolet light and/or exposure to ceric
ammonium molybdate, \textit{p}-anisaldehyde, or potassium permanganate stains.

drying over \ce{P2O5} before use. Molecular sieves (3\AA, 4-8 mesh) were purchased from Aldrich and
activated by drying under vacuum (approx. 30 mm Hg) at 250 \degc\  for at least 6 hours prior to
use.
Rhodium chloride hydrate (\ce{RhCl3.H2O}) was purchased from Pressure Chemical Co. and used
without further purification. Anhydrous ammonia was purchased from Airgas Inc. and distilled
from sodium metal prior to use. Dess-Martin Periodinane was prepared according to the reported
literature procedure.\footnote{{\frenchspacing Meyer, S. D.; Schreiber, S. L. Acceleration of the
Dess-Martin Oxidation by Water. \textit{J. Org. Chem.} \textbf{1994}, \textit{59}, 7549-7552.}} Scandium triflate (Sc(OTf)$_3$) (99\%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, finely powdered, and then dried at 200 \degc\  over \ce{P2O5} for 24 hours under high vacuum (0.1 mm Hg).

 \degc\ in a drybox.
 Note:
 TMSD is both non-explosive and non-mutagenic, however it is extremely toxic and should be handled with the appropriate precautions.

\subsubsection{Instrumentation}
Infrared spectra were recorded on a Bruker Alpha-p spectrometer. Bands are reported as
strong (s), medium (m), weak (w), broad strong (bs), broad medium (bm), and broad weak (bw).
Optical rotation data were recorded on a Rudolph research Autopol IV automatic polarimeter and
is reported as the average of five readings. Melting points were recorded on a Digimelt MPA160
SRS and are uncorrected. Sonication was performed with a Misonix$\textsuperscript{\textregistered}$ Sonicator 3000 equipped
with a Laude external circulator. $^1$H NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian VNMRS (500
MHz), INOVA (500 MHz), or VNMRS (400 MHz) spectrometer. Chemical shifts are reported in
ppm from tetramethylsilane with the solvent resonance as the internal standard (CHCl$_3$: $\delta$
7.26).
Data are reported as follows: chemical shift, multiplicity (s = singlet, d = doublet, dd = doublet of
doublets, ddd = doublet of doublet of doublets, dddd = doublet of doublet of doublet of doublets, t
= triplet, m = multiplet), coupling constants (Hz), and integration. $^{13}$C NMR spectra were

% Reductive alkylation
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\noindent\textbf{General procedure for dissolved metal reductive alkylation:}
A flame-dried, 2-neck, 25 mL round bottom
flask equipped with a cold finger condenser, septum, and a magnetic stir bar was charged with
lithium wire (5.8 mg, 0.83 mmol, 3.0 equiv), and the entire apparatus was flame-dried again.
After backfilling with argon, the apparatus was cooled to $-$78 \degc, and ammonia (3.6 mL) was
freshly distilled from sodium metal into the reaction flask, dissolving the lithium wire and
forming a deep blue solution. A solution of enone \ref{cmp:xbah} (50.0 mg, 0.277 mmol, 1.00 equiv)
in 2.0 mL of THF was then added to the dissolved metal solution over 30 minutes \textit{via} syringe
pump.
Upon completion of the addition, the reaction mixture was warmed to $-$25 \degc\  and stirred at
this temperature for 1 hour. The solution was then re-cooled to $-$78 \degc\  and diluted with 1.2
mL of THF. In a separate flask, a solution of the appropriate electrophile (1.39 mmol, 5.0 equiv) in
1.6 mL THF was pre-cooled to $-$78 \degc\  and then added as rapidly as possible to the blue
solution \textit{via} syringe.
Almost immediately, the deep blue color bleached to white, and stirring was continued at $-$
78 \degc\  for 8 hours. The reaction mixture was then warmed slowly to room temperature, and the
ammonia was allowed to evaporate from the reaction mixture. During this time, pressure generated from the vaporization of ammonia was liberated through an exit needle or through an
external bubbler. The basic solution was acidified by the addition of 20 mL of saturated aqueous
NH$_4$Cl. The mixture was poured into a separatory funnel, and the product was extracted with
Et$_2$O (3 x 20 mL). The combined organics were washed with H$_2$O (15 mL), saturated aqueous
NaCl (15 mL), dried over \ce{Na2SO4}, filtered, and concentrated to afford the crude product.
Purification was carried out by flash column chromatography on silica gel (ethyl acetate in
hexanes). \textit{Note:} This reaction must be carried out under an atmosphere of argon gas, as the
use of nitrogen gas results in reaction with lithium metal to form considerable amounts of lithium nitride (Li$_3$N).

mg, 3.86 mmol, 7.00 equiv) was weighed into a 2-neck, 25 mL round
bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirbar. After removing the flask
from the drybox, a reflux condenser was installed. 4.2 mL of DMSO was
added, and the suspension was heated to 75 \degc\  for 1 hour. During this
time, the reaction became homogeneous, forming a teal-colored, clear solution. This solution was
cooled to room temperature, and a solution of \ce{Ph3PCH3I} (2.01 mg, 4.96 mmol, 9.00 equiv) in 6.8
mL of DMSO was added over 30 minutes \textit{via} syringe pump. Upon addition of the salt solution,
the reaction mixture became bright yellow. After completion of the addition, the mixture was
stirred for an additional 30 minutes at room temperature, at which point a solution of ketone
\ref{cmp:xbbb} (307 mg, 0.551 mmol, 1.00 equiv) in 1.5 mL of DMSO and 1.5 mL of THF was added
dropwise.
The reaction mixture was then heated to 75 \degc\  and stirred for 16 hours. The resulting amber
solution was cooled to room temperature and acidified by the addition of 5 mL of saturated aqueous
NH$_4$Cl. The reaction mixture was diluted with H$_2$O (15 mL), poured into a separatory funnel, and
the product was extracted with Et$_2$O (3 x 20 mL). The combined organics were washed with H$_2$O
(25 mL), saturated aqueous NaCl (20 mL), dried over \ce{Na2SO4}, filtered, and concentrated.
