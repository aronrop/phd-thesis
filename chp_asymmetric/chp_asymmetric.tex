 \section{Introduction}
 \doublespacing
 
 In previous work, we had
 demonstrated that scandium (III) salts function as highly effective catalysts for the diazoalkane carbonyl homologation reaction.\footnote{See chapter \ref{chp:diazobkg} for a more thorough discussion.

 begin developing a general catalytic enantioselective version of the reaction. In the ideal transformation, a generic
 ketone, when combined with a chiral scandium catalyst and diazoalkane would undergo a regio-- and
 stereoselective union to deliver a new homologated ketone (\ce{->}\ref{cmp:asaaa}, \refscheme{generalrxn}).
 We believed it would be logical to start by extending the ring expansion of symmetrical
 cycloalkanones to stereoselective insertion reactions.\footnote{{\frenchspacing Rendina, V. L.;

 By starting from symmetrical cycloalkanones of the appropriate ring size,\footnote{The
 order of reactivity for the ring expansion of cycloalkanones with diazomethane based on literature

 cycloheptanone $>$ cyclopentanone. \frenchspacing{Gutsche, C.

problems of regiochemical control could be removed and issues with overhomologation could be
minimized initially.
The ultimate goal of the project was to develop general methods for the construction alkyl, vinyl, and aryl
 bearing stereogenic centers adjacent to the carbonyl functionality.

 We felt confident that by combining scandium (III) salts with the correct chiral ligand, the
 catalyst ligand complex would efficiently direct the stereochemical outcome of the newly forged
 \ce{C-C} bonds. A survey of the Cambridge Structural Database\footnote{{\frenchspacing
 Cambridge Structural Database (WebCSD). http://webcsd.ccdc.cam.ac.uk.proxy.bc.edu (accessed Jan 25, 2013).}} revealed
 four crystal structures containing chiral ligands bound to scandium triflate.
 Among the most well characterized and widely studied are the scandium PyBOX complexes reported by
 the Evans' group (\ref{cmp:asaaaa} and \ref{cmp:asaaab}, \reffigure{xraypage}).\footnote{ (a)

 Three of the four
 structures in \reffigure{xraypage} contain a seven
 coordinate pentagonal bipyramidal metal geometry. Scandium (III), because of its filled valence shell
 and lack of \textit{d} electrons, tends to adopt coordination geometries that are based primarily
 on steric constraints rather than traditional orbital overlap based geometries
 observed for the transition metals.\footnote{{\frenchspacing Wu, J. Enantioselective

  In the sections that follow, an account of how we developed the first catalytic asymmetric
  diazoalkane carbon insertion reactions is presented. The crystallographic data from the literature
  suggests a logical starting point for the development of a new method based on chiral scandium complexes. Ligand constructs
 known to form competent catalysts with Sc(III) salts would be among the first screened for
 asymmetric induction. Before discussing
  experimental details, a brief background on alternative methods for the synthesis of
  $\alpha$-substituted cycloalkanones is given.

 \section{Methods for Asymmetric $\alpha$-Functionalization of
 Cycloalkanones}
 
 \subsection{Construction of $\alpha$-Tertiary Centers}
 
 One of the most common methods for \ce{C-C} bond construction involves the
 $\alpha$-functionalization of ketone enolates.
 Some of the first sucessful methods for $\alpha$-functionalized of cycloalkanes in a
 stereocontrolled fashion relied extensively on the pre-formation of chiral imines or hydrazones. In
 1976, Meyers and coworkers reported a highly enantioselective synthesis of 2-alkyl substituted
 cyclohexanones through the formation of a lithio-chelated enamine
 nucleophile (\ref{cmp:asaab}, \refscheme{asmeyers}).\footnote{{\frenchspacing Meyers, A. I.;

 R.; Druelinger, M.
 Enantioselective Alkylation of Cyclohexanone via Chiral Lithio-Chelated Enamines. \textit{J. Am.
 Chem. Soc.} \textbf{1976}, \textit{98}, 3032-3033.}} Upon treatment with an alkyl electrophile,
 a stereoselective trap of the electrophile lead to products in up to 97.5:2.5 er
 after careful imine hydrolysis.
 The introduction of a chelating methyl ether moiety rigidified the proposed metalloenamine
 intermediate \ref{cmp:asaab} and led to much higher levels of stereocontrol than previous reports
 with imines that lacked an additional chelating group.\footnote{(a) {\frenchspacing Mea-Jacheet, D.; Horeau, A. Asymmetric Synthesis and Optical purity of 2-Methylcyclohexanone. \textit{Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr.} \textbf{1968}, 4571-4573.} (b) {\frenchspacing Kitamoto, M.; Hiroi, K.; Terashima, S.

  \caption{Meyers auxiliary based approach for $\alpha$-alkylation.}
  \label{sch:asmeyers}
\end{Scheme}   
 
 Around the time of Meyers work, the Enders group introduced the proline derived chiral auxiliary
 (\textit{S})-1-amino-2-methoxymethylpyrrolidine (SAMP, \ref{cmp:asaad}, \refscheme{assamp}), which
 contained a very similar chelating functional group.\footnote{{\frenchspacing Enders, D.; Eichenauer, H.
 Asymmetric Synthesis of $\alpha$-Substituted Ketones by Metalation and Alkylation of Chiral Hydrazones. \textit{Angew.
 Chem. Int. Ed.} \textbf{1976}, \textit{15}, 549-551.}} The SAMP auxiliary and related derivatives
 have been widely utilized for their often very high and predictable levels of stereoinduction and
 for their mild and varied means of cleavage.\footnote{For a recent review see: {\frenchspacing Job, A.; Janeck, C. F.; Bettray, W.;
 Peters, R.; Enders, D. The SAMP-/RAMP-Hydrazone Methodology in Asymmetric Synthesis.
 \textit{Tetrahedron} \textbf{2002}, \textit{58}, 2253-2329.}} In the context of a cycloheptanone
 substrate, the Holmes group sucessfully applied a SAMP hydrazone alkylation strategy to their
 enantioselective synthesis of ($-$)-gloeosporone
 (\ce{->}\ref{cmp:asaac}, \refscheme{assamp}).\footnote{{\frenchspacing Curtis, N.
 R.; Holmes, A. B.; Looney, M. G.; Pearson, N. D.; Slim, G. C. Synthesis of ($-$)-Gloeosporone.
 \textit{Tetrahedron Lett.} \textbf{1991}, \textit{32}, 537-540.}} Cleavage of the auxiliary was
 achieved by treatment with ozone at low temperature, delivering the target cycloheptanone
 \ref{cmp:asaaca} in 97:3 er.

  \caption{Application of Ender's SAMP auxiliary in total synthesis.}
  \label{sch:assamp}
\end{Scheme}   
 
More modern strategies have focused on the use of chiral catalysts to control stereochemistry, which
foregoes the need to pre-install a costly chiral auxiliary in the substrate. The formation of an
$\alpha$-tertiary center requires control over either the installation of the $\alpha$-substituent
through an asymmetric alkylation event or control over installation of the $\alpha$-hydrogen. Aside
from stoichiometric auxiliary-based approaches, catalytic methods for enolate alkylation based on
phase transfer catalysts\footnote{{\frenchspacing Dolling, U. H.; Davis, P.; Grabowski, E. J. J.

\textit{via} Chiral Phase-Transfer Catalysis. \textit{J. Am. Chem. Soc.} \textbf{1984}, \textit{106}, 446-447.}} and chiral lithium enolates\footnote{{\frenchspacing Imai, M.; Hagihara, A.; Kawasaki, H.; Manabe, K.; Koga, K. Catalytic Asymmetric Benzylation of Achiral Lithium Enolates Using a Chiral Ligand for Lithium in the Presence of an Achiral Ligand. \textit{J. Am. Chem. Soc.}
\textbf{1994}, \textit{116}, 8829-8830.}} have also been demonstrated. Alternative approaches have
examined catalytic methods for the installation of an $\alpha$-hydrogen through an enantioselective
enolate protonation event.\footnote{For a review see:
{\frenchspacing Mohr, J.
T.; Hong, A.
Y.; Stoltz, B.
M.
Enantioselective Protonation. \textit{Nature Chem.} \textbf{2009}, \textit{1}, 359-369.}} Achieving
stereocontrol while delivering a group as small as a proton has been a significant challenge and
the subject of considerable research.
 
In 2005, the Yanagisawa group introduced an asymmetric protonation method utilizing a simple
catalyst system derived from commercially available silver fluoride and (\textit{R})-BINAP.\footnote{{\frenchspacing Yanagisawa, A.; Touge, T.; Arai, T.

\ce{Binap.AgF} Complex. \textit{Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.} \textbf{2005}, \textit{44}, 1546-1548.}
\label{ref:asyanagisawa}} Starting from a pre-formed silyl enol ether, face selective delivery of
the proton from methanol was proposed to proceed through a silver fluoride BINAP complex that delivered methanol while
concomitantly deprotecting the silyl ether (\ref{cmp:asaae}, \refscheme{asyanagisawaproton}). High
yields and near perfect enantioselectivities were observed across a range of 2-aryl substituted cyclic substrates. The
Yamamoto group also demonstrated a very similar asymmetric protonation reaction with a comparable
substrate scope using a non-commercial chiral phosphoric acid catalyst.\footnote{{\frenchspacing

  \caption{Yanagisawa's asymmetric protonation of silyl enol ethers.}
  \label{sch:asyanagisawaproton}
\end{Scheme}  
 
 
 
 The Stoltz group has also examined enantioselective protonation reactions in the context
 of palladium enolates.\footnote{(a) {\frenchspacing Mohr, J. T.; Nishimata, T.; Behenna, D.
 C.; Stoltz, B.

 Homogeneous Pd-Catalyzed Enantioselective Decarboxylative Protonation. \textit{Org. Lett.}
 \textbf{2008}, \textit{10}, 1039-1042.} \label{ref:stoltzprotonation}} When a racemic allyl
 $\beta$-ketoester (\ref{cmp:asaaf}, \refscheme{asstoltzprotonation}) is combined with Pd(0) in the presence of
 PHOX ligand \ref{cmp:asaah}, oxidative addition to the allyl group followed by decarboxylation
 furnishes a chiral palladium enolate intermediate. By adding a superstoichiometric amount of
 Meldrum's acid (\ref{cmp:asaag}, 2.5 equiv), the reaction can be effectively interrupted before
 reductive elimination to deliver $\alpha$-tertiary substituted cycloalkanones in high yields and enantioselectivities. The catalytic cycle is closed by ultimately delivering the allyl fragment to the Meldrum's acid enolate, regenerating the
 Pd(0) catalyst.

  \label{sch:asstoltzprotonation}
\end{Scheme}   
 
 
 Another strategy, not based on enolate alkylation or asymmetric protonation, was developed by the
 Hoveyda group. Enantioselective conjugate addition of alkylzinc reagents to nitroalkenes catalyzed
 by a chiral copper complex, followed by acidic Nef hydrolysis, affords $\alpha$-tertiary
 substituted cycloalkanones (\refscheme{ashoveydaconj}).\footnote{{\frenchspacing Luchaco-Cullis, C.

 \textbf{2002}, \textit{124}, 8192-8193.}} The hydrolysis, carried out in a subsequent step with
 20\% aqueous sulfuric acid, leads to minimal racemization of the products. Notably, the method
 was amenable to the synthesis of a variety of ring sizes and high levels of enantioselectivity
 were observed from 5 to 12 membered rings.

 The Shi group introduced a two-step protocol to access optically active
 2-aryl cyclopentanones using an enantioselective epoxidation of
 cyclobutylidene olefins (\refscheme{asshirearrangement}).\footnote{{\frenchspacing Shen, Y.-M.;
 Wang, B.; Shi, Y.

 trisubstituted cyclobutylidene olefins with catalyst \ref{cmp:asaaj} in the presence of Oxone\regtm\  delivered
 the intermediate chiral epoxides in high yields and enantioselectivities. Upon exposure of the
 epoxides to \ce{Et2AlCl}, a facile and highly selective rearrangement to the 2-aryl substituted
 cyclopentanones occurred. Shi also showed that by simply adding lithium iodide during the
 Lewis-acid mediated rearrangement, the opposite enantiomer of the cyclopentanones could be obtained with high
 stereochemical fidelity. This obviates the need to synthesize the opposite enantiomer of catalyst
 \ref{cmp:asaaj}, which can often be challenging if the source of chirality is ultimately derived
 from a chiral pool molecule. This method was extended to the synthesis of $\alpha$-quaternary
 cyclopentanones by starting from tetrasubstituted cyclobutylidene olefins.\footnote{{\frenchspacing Shen, Y.-M.; Wang, B.; Shi, Y.

 cycloalkanones with \ref{cmp:asaajb} and CAN facilitates access to a unique three electron
 $\pi$-system (\ref{cmp:asaaja}) through a single electron oxidation event. Face-selective radical
 coupling with substituted allyl trimethylsilanes lead directly to $\alpha$-tertiary substituted
 chiral cycloalkanones with excellent enantioselectivity.

 Tetrasubstituted tin enolates underwent smooth conversion to the $\alpha$-quaternary cycloalkanones
 upon treatment with chromium salen complex \ref{cmp:asaak} and an appropriate alkyl electrophile.
 Cycloalkanones of varying ring sizes were isolated in moderate to high yields with excellent levels of stereocontrol over the newly constructed \ce{C-C} bond. Trisubstituted tin
 enolates that would lead to $\alpha$-tertiary products decomposed under the reaction conditions and
 afforded products in low yields and modest enantioselectivities.

 all-carbon quaternary centers containing an aromatic substituent. In Buchwald's approach, a two step sequence involving formylation and condensation to prepare an $\alpha$' blocked vinylogous amide
(\ref{cmp:asaal}, \refscheme{asbuchwaldarylation}) was necessary to prevent enolization and coupling
from occuring on the left half of the molecule.
Hartwig focused on indanone and tetralone substrates lacking enolizable $\alpha$' protons
(\refscheme{ashartwigarylation}).
Both methods utilized sodium \textit{tert}-butoxide to generate a sodium enolate that
transmetallated to a chiral Pd(II) or Ni(II) intermediate and ultimately underwent a stereoselective
reductive elimination to forge the new \ce{C-aryl} bond. Buchwald then cleaved the vinylogous amide
protecting group through a dilute acid mediated retro-Claisen condensation. The primary differences
between the two methods were in the choice of chiral ligand and aryl coupling partner. Buchwald
later expanded the substrate scope to include vinyl electrophiles.\footnote{{\frenchspacing Chieffi, A.; Kamikawa, K.; \AA hman, J.; Fox, J. M.; Buchwald, S. L. Catalytic Asymmetric Vinylation of Ketone Enolates. \textit{Org. Lett.}

 With the exception of MacMillan's notable allylation reactions,\crossref{ref:macmillansomo} all of
 the previous examples required a multi-step sequence to install functional group handles that would
 be utilized in the key stereodefining reaction and then ultimately removed to access the target
 cycloalkanone products. We envisioned developing a general strategy to directly access a broad
 range of chiral $\alpha$-substituted cycloalkanones in a single carbon insertion step with aryl--,
 vinyl--, and alkyl-substituted diazoalkanes.
 The versatility and prevalence of the ketone functional group justifies the development of
 methods complementary to those aforementioned.

 \section{Discovery of a Catalyst System for Asymmetric $\alpha$-Arylation}
 
 We initially decided to target the enantioselective $\alpha$-arylation of cycloalkanones for two
 primary reasons.
 The Brewer group had recently introduced a mild and operationally simple method for the synthesis of
 aryl-substituted diazoalkanes based on a modified Swern oxidation procedure.\footnote{(a)
 {\frenchspacing Javed, M. I.; Brewer, M. Diazo Preparation \textit{via} Dehydrogenation of
 Hydrazones with Activated DMSO. \textit{Org. Lett.} \textbf{2007}, \textit{9}, 1789-1792.} (b)
 {\frenchspacing Javed, M. I.; Brewer, M. Diphenyldiazomethane. \textit{Org. Synth.} \textbf{2008},
 \textit{85}, 189-195.} \label{ref:asbrewer}}  A simple protocol for preparing the requisite
 diazoalkanes, coupled with the relative stability of aryl-substituted
 diazoalkanes,\footnote{For the relative reactivity of substituted diazoalkanes see \reffigure{nucleophilicity} on page
 \pageref{fig:nucleophilicity}.} made $\alpha$-arylation an ideal proving ground for the first asymmetric insertion
 reactions.

In advance of looking at any catalytic asymmetric reactions, we wanted to run a control experiment
to determine if the products of our reaction would retain their stereochemical information in the
presence of scandium triflate. The Shi group reported earlier that $\alpha$-aryl cyclopentanones
readily racemize on silica gel, presumably through a rather facile enolization
pathway.\crossref{ref:asshitertiary} We began by preparing an optically active sample of
(\textit{R})-2-phenylcycloheptanone according to a three step sequence using the asymmetric
protonation chemistry developed by Yanagisawa
(\refscheme{asracemizationone}).\crossref{ref:asyanagisawa}
  \begin{Scheme}[h]

  \caption{Preparation of optically active 2-phenylcycloheptanone.}
  \label{sch:asracemizationone}
\end{Scheme}   
Scandium-catalyzed homologation of cyclohexanone with phenyldiazomethane (\ref{cmp:diazoaa})
afforded racemic 2-phenylcycloheptanone (\ref{cmp:xaaa}) in a 65\% distilled yield. Dropwise
addition of 0.95 equivalents of LDA to \ref{cmp:xaaa} followed by trapping with TMSCl selectively
delivered the thermodynamic enol silane \ref{cmp:asaaq} in 85\% yield.
Asymmetric protonation according to the reported conditions provided access
(\textit{R})-2-phenylcycloheptanone (\ref{cmp:asaar}) in 83\% yield and 95:5 er in our
hands.\footnote{The Yanagisawa group reported a 95\% yield and 98.5:1.5 er for the preparation of 
\ref{cmp:asaar}.
See reference \ref{ref:asyanagisawa} for details.} Exposure of \ref{cmp:asaar} to phenyldiazomethane,
\ce{Sc(OTf)3}, or the combination of the two (toluene, 0 \degc, 6 h) resulted in no loss of enantiopurity (95:5 er by chiral SFC analysis). This promising initial result indicated that chiral homologation products should be configurationally
stable under conditions of scandium catalysis. \refscheme{asracemizationone} also
underscores the benefits of eliminating the three step sequence that must precede asymmetric protonation, as products like \ref{cmp:asaar} could
be accessible in a single asymmetric homologation step.


We also wanted to run a simple mechanistic control to determine if the scandium-catalyzed reactions
proceeded through a pathway involving an epoxide intermediate. House had previously shown that
epoxides formed in Lewis acid mediated ring expansion reactions readily underwent rearrangement
to the corresponding aldehydes.\footnote{{\frenchspacing House, H. O.; Grubbs, E. J.; Gannon, W. F.
The Reaction of Ketones with Diazomethane. \textit{J. Am. Chem. Soc.} \textbf{1960}, \textit{82},
4099-4106.}} We had never detected any epoxide or aldehyde byproducts in any scandium catalyzed ring expansion reactions (by $^1$H NMR), but regardless, we carried out the experiment shown in \refscheme{asepoxideexperiment}. Epoxide \ref{cmp:asaara} was obtained
through standard chemistry in an 87\% yield over two steps from cyclohexanone. Subjecting
epoxide \ref{cmp:asaara} to 10 mol \% \ce{Sc(OTf)3} at $-78$ \degc\  for 5 days resulted in $<$2\%
conversion, clearly indicating that it was improbable the scandium catalyzed homologation reactions
involved an epoxide intermediate. The most plausible mechanism was that
previously discussed in the literature, a concerted collapse of a diazonium
betaine to directly deliver the observed ring expanded products
(\refscheme{mechanism}, page \pageref{sch:mechanism}).\crossref{ref:asgutscherev}

\subsection{Optimized Conditions for Consistent Reactivity}

  \end{wrapfigure}
The newly discovered scandium catalyzed homologation reactions often gave variable and
unpredictable results that appeared to depend on the source of \ce{Sc(OTf)3} and batch of
diazoalkane solution.
In order to obtain meaningful results when optimizing conditions for asymmetric reactions, the reaction
variability would first need to be understood and mitigated. At the time this project began,
no special protocols were in place to purify any of the reaction components. The \ce{Sc(OTf)3} was
often used as received and the aryl-diazoalkanes were prepared by directly following the
reported Brewer procedure.\crossref{ref:asbrewer} In order to mimimize reaction variability, efforts
were undertaken to rigorously purify and dry \textit{all} reaction components: solvents,
\ce{Sc(OTf)3}, ketones, diazoalkanes, and ligands.

Scandium triflate is a deliquescent solid that rapidly absorbs significant quantities of atmospheric
moisture. Crystallographic data from the literature has shown \ce{Sc(OTf)3} to bind up to nine water
molecules (\reffigure{asscandiumhydrated}).\footnote{{\frenchspacing Abbasi, A.; Lindqvist-Reis, P.;

aqueous media,\footnote{{\frenchspacing Kobayashi, S.; Hachiya, I. Lanthanide Triflates as

reaction efficiencies for diazoalkane insertion reactions.\footnote{Reaction rates can be
approximated visually by the evolution of nitrogen gas and the loss of the characteristic
diazoalkane color.} When Kobayashi first introduced \ce{Sc(OTf)3} in
1993, he reported drying the salt at 200 \degc\ under high vacuum before use.\footnote{{\frenchspacing Kobayashi, S.; Hachiya, I.; Araki, M.; Ishitani, H.

Reaction. \textit{Tetrahedron Lett.} \textbf{1993}, \textit{34}, 3755-3758.}} We took this drying
method one step further and dried commercial \ce{Sc(OTf)3} under high vacuum at 200 \degc\  with
inline \ce{P2O5} for 24 hours before taking the salt into an inert atmosphere glove box using
rigorous Schlenk techniques.

Diazoalkane solutions were originally prepared according to the general procedure reported by Brewer.\crossref{ref:asbrewer} In a typical experimental procedure, a
solution of the hydrazone and triethylamine were added dropwise to a cold solution of chlorodimethylsulfonium chloride, formed \textit{in situ} from oxalyl chloride and DMSO (\refscheme{asbrewerswern}).
After stirring for an hour at $-$78 \degc, the reaction mixture was filtered to remove insoluble
triethylammonium chloride and carefully concentrated to remove THF. The neat diazoalkane was then
dissolved in toluene and stored at $-78$ \degc. Following this procedure gave fairly pure
diazoalkane solutions, but we wanted to be sure to remove all traces of Lewis basic impurities. We modified the procedure to include an aqueous workup which
removed any residual triethylamine and DMSO. The oxidation was run for one hour
in a 9:1 \ce{Et2O}:\ce{CH2Cl2} solvent mixture and immediately poured into a separatory funnel
containing an ice cold 50\% solution of aqueous \ce{NH4Cl}. The \ce{NH4Cl} layer was drained and the
organics were washed with \ce{H2O} and saturated \ce{NaHCO3} before drying over solid \ce{K2CO3}. Filtration,
concentration, and finally dissolution in toluene afforded exceptionally pure diazoalkane solutions. 
\begin{Scheme}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{chp_asymmetric/images/brewerswern}
  \begin{textblock}{1}(16,-0.7) \crossrefcmp{diazoaa} \end{textblock}
  \caption{Original preparation of aryl-substituted diazoalkanes by Brewer.}
  \label{sch:asbrewerswern}
\end{Scheme}  

Unfortunately, by performing an aqueous workup on the diazoalkanes, we inadvertently introduced an
additional problem. Occasionally we would observe the formation of a white precipitate in some of
the diazoalkane solutions after prolonged storage at $-78$ \degc. After numerous unsuccessful
attempts to isolate and characterize the white precipitate, we realized that it was residual water
from inefficient drying of diazoalkane solution after workup. Although \ce{K2CO3} was not the most
efficient dessicant, the highest yields of diazoalkane were obtained with solutions dried over
\ce{K2CO3}. The residual water was ultimately best removed by carefully gravity filtering the
diazoalkane solution at $-$78 \degc\ in a cold-jacketed dropping funnel, then storing the clear
solution over 3\AA\ molecular sieves.

With rigorously dried \ce{Sc(OTf)3}, pure and dry diazoalkane solutions, distilled ketones, and
solvents passed through an alumina column and stored over 3\AA\ molecular
sieves,\footnote{{\frenchspacing Williams, D.

G.; Lawton, M.

efficiency were observed.\footnote{{\frenchspacing Rendina, V. L.; Kaplan, H. Z.; Kingsbury, J. S.

\label{ref:asrendinapsp}} More importantly though, reactions worked in a predictable and
reproducible manner.
When we had prepared racemic 2-phenylcycloheptanone (\ref{cmp:xaaa}) previously,
the reaction was run with 10 mol \% \ce{Sc(OTf)3} and 1.1 equivalents of phenyldiazomethane
(\ref{cmp:diazoaa}) for 16 hours (\refscheme{asracemizationone},
page \pageref{sch:asracemizationone}).
After workup and attempted purification by silica gel chromatography, the desired product was obtained in a quantitative yield but was contaminated with overhomologation byproducts.\footnote{Not isolated, but double insertion was detected by low resolution mass spectrometry. \ce{C20H23O} [M+H]$^+$: 279.1749.} Careful K\"{u}gelrohr distillation delivered analytically pure material in a modest 65\% yield. Under the new drier conditions, running the reaction for 15 minutes with 0.5 mol \% \ce{Sc(OTf)3}, 1.0
equivalents of phenyldiazomethane, and 1.2 equivalents of cyclohexanone, a 92\% isolated yield was
obtained after silica gel chromatography. By modifying the stoichiometry, no further purification
away from overhomologation byproducts was necessary. The reaction rates were so high, an 18 gauge
exit needle was needed to relieve excess pressure generated by the copious amounts of nitrogen gas evolved.

The newly optimized conditions were successfully applied to a number of ring expansion reactions
with aryl-substituted diazoalkanes (\refscheme{asrendinapspsubstrates}).\crossref{ref:asrendinapsp}
Good scope with regard to the diazoalkane and ketone ring size were demonstrated. Reactions
catalyzed by low loadings of \ce{Sc(OTf)3} (0.5--7 mol \%) were complete in $<$1 hour and gave high
yields in all cases tested. In addition to being reliable and efficient, the reactions could be
scaled to afford gram quantities of homologation products (\ce{->}\ref{cmp:xaac}). With reliable
protocols in place and an understanding that water was the culprit of previous reproducibility
issues, we were prepared to examine asymmetric insertion reactions. 

\subsection{Early Results with Bis(oxazoline) Ligands}

We began by evaluating the PyBOX\crossref{ref:asevans} and bipyridine
diol\crossref{ref:askobayashistructure} ligand frameworks previously reported to form competent
chiral scandium complexes (\refscheme{asinitialligandscreen}). In an inert atmosphere glove box,
\ce{Sc(OTf)3} was stirred in toluene with a slight excess of the ligand for 1.5 hours to pre-form
the ligand-metal complex. During complexation, 25 mol \% THF was added as a cosolvent to help
solubilize the scandium salt. The catalyst mixture was removed from the glove box, connected to a nitrogen manifold, and stirred with cyclohexanone for 15 minutes. After cooling to $-$78 \degc,
phenyldiazomethane (\ref{cmp:diazoaa}) was added in a single portion and the reactions were stirred
until no further evolution of nitrogen gas was observed. An aliquot of the reaction mixture was purified by
preparative thin-layer chromatography and analyzed for optical purity by chiral SFC analysis in
comparison with authentic racemic material. Commercially available PyBOX ligand \ref{cmp:asaas}
delivered \ref{cmp:xaan} in a measurable 56:44 er. The bipyridine diol ligand \ref{cmp:asaat} afforded racemic product. We also tested a
commercially available Salen\footnote{{\frenchspacing Larrow, J. F.; Jacobsen, E. N. Asymmetric
Processes Catalyzed by Chiral (Salen)Metal Complexes. \textit{Topics Organomet. Chem.} \textbf{2004}, \textit{6},
123-152.}} ligand which produced nearly racemic product. Ligands \ref{cmp:asaat} and \ref{cmp:asaau}
were likely not stable under the reaction conditions, as diazoalkanes are known to undergo \ce{O-H}
insertion reactions.\footnote{See the discussion in Chapter \ref{chp:diazobkg} for examples.}
Etherification of the two \ce{O-H} groups would decrease the binding affinity of the ligand and
metal, leading to background reaction by uncomplexed scandium.

Previous experiments had shown that Lewis basic impurities could dramatically affect reaction
efficiency. Reactions run with PyBOX ligand \ref{cmp:asaas} visually progressed more slowly than
those without the ligand present. We believed that by excising the bridging pyridine ring, we
could decrease the Lewis basicity of the ligand while simultaneously bringing the ligand blocking
groups closer to the metal center. The well known bis(oxazoline) ligand class retains the blocking
group structure of the PyBOX ligands, but contains a methylene bridge between the two oxazoline
units. While scandium PyBOX crystal structures have been reported, there are no examples of scandium
bis(oxazoline) structures. In contrast, a preponderance of bis(oxazoline) copper
complexes have been reported.\footnote{Nineteen Cu(II) bis(oxazoline) crystal

We quickly tested several readily available BOX ligands, hoping the different steric
and electronic properties would translate into increased levels of stereoinduction
(\refscheme{asfirstboxscreen}).
We were pleased to see that ligand \ref{cmp:boxasab} provided much higher levels of selectivity. Different blocking
groups (\ref{cmp:boxasaa}, \ref{cmp:boxasac}) and bis(oxazoline) \ref{cmp:boxasad} resulted in
lower selectivity. Excited by this promising lead, we initiated a broader screen of BOX ligands
(\refscheme{asbigboxscreen}). The bis(oxazoline) framework contains three diversity sites for
C$_2$-symmetric ligands, making it a highly tunable and privileged ligand
class.\crossref{ref:asboxreview} We wanted to simultaneously optimize with regard to both backbone substitution and the amino alcohol derived blocking groups.\footnote{For a lead reference on the

Examination of the results in \refscheme{asbigboxscreen} showed that backbone substitution was
integral to obtaining high levels of induction. Ligands lacking geminal substitution on the bridging
methylene are known to tautomerize, which could adversely impact the ligand-metal
binding. We prepared a series of ligands containing cyclic backbone
substitution to probe the effect of bite angle on enantioselectivity. Davies and coworkers had
prepared a similar series of BOX ligands and observed a strong dependence of enantioselectivity on ligand bite
angle in copper catalyzed Diels-Alder reactions.\footnote{(a) {\frenchspacing Davies, I. W. I. W.;

\end{Scheme}
Ligand \ref{cmp:ligandac}, containing a three-membered ring backbone, showed the highest selectivity
(87:13 er) among the series, consistent with the results obtained by Davies. However, no clear trend
emerged from these data. Ligand \ref{cmp:ligandad} showed a significant drop in selectivty (55:45
er), which was regained again with ligand \ref{cmp:ligandae} (85.5:14.5 er). Purity of the ligand
may have been a determining factor, as ligand \ref{cmp:ligandad} was not as easy to crystallize
cleanly as the others in the series. Some of the ligands in \refscheme{asbigboxscreen} have also
been observed to crystallize as a solvate complex with water. Changing the blocking group to a single phenyl ring on each half and placing geminal methyl groups
on the backbone afforded comparable levels of selectivity (ligand \ref{cmp:boxasae}, 85:15 er).
Installing geminal ethyl groups on the backbone increased the selectivity slightly
(\ref{cmp:boxasaf}, 89:11 er), but with geminal benzyl groups the selectivity dropped
(\ref{cmp:ligandal}, 57:43 er). Running with \textit{tert}-leucine derived BOX \ref{cmp:boxasag}
gave completely racemic material. Curiously, phenylalanine derived BOX \ref{cmp:boxasai} and
indanyl BOX \ref{cmp:ligandaa} gave an identical 91:9 er. Material from the reaction with ligand
\ref{cmp:boxasai} was isolated in an excellent 93\% yield.

We hoped at this point that we could spend time further refining and optimizing the reaction
conditions with commercially available BOX ligand \ref{cmp:boxasai} to improve the selectivity beyond 91:9 er.
Significant effort was invested in optimizing the reaction with regard to stoichiometry, solvent, temperature, and even
various additives (\reftable{asoptimization}). Reactions run in \ce{CH2Cl2} afforded lower
selectivities, but the values were consistent regardless of changes with respect to
stoichiometry (entries 1--6). Using coordinating solvents either shut down the reaction in the case of \ce{CH3CN} (entry
7), or gave lower levels of selectivity in the case of \ce{Et2O} (entry 8). Entry 10, run in
toluene at $-$90 \degc, showed the highest selectivity at 92.5:7.5 er. The freezing point of toluene
($-$95 \degc) and the practicality of running reactions at temperatures lower than $-78$ \degc\
prevented us from looking at even lower temperatures. We looked at various additives other than THF
hoping that the appropriate additive could help solubilize or stabilize the chiral catalyst. Adding
25 mol \%  \ce{CH3CN}, \ce{Et2O}, or DME  effectively had no impact on the
selectivity (entries 11--13). Addition of 2,6-lutidine or pyridine had a detrimental effect on both
reaction kinetics and the observed enantioselectivity (entries 14, 15). This may help rationalize
why reactions with PyBOX ligand \ref{cmp:asaas} were sluggish and only moderately selective. We also
found that although THF appeared to help solubilize the catalyst mixture, it was unnecessary to
obtain high levels of selectivity (entry 17). By pre-mixing the catalyst suspension with
cyclohexanone for 15 minutes, the reaction mixture became homogeneous and afforded comparable
levels of enantioselectivity (90:10 er).
Dropping the catalyst loading to 5 mol \% had no effect on the enantioselectivity and increasing the catalyst loading to 20 mol \% gave an identical result (entries 18, 19).

\subsection{Optimal Conditions for Medium Ring Arylation}
  
After struggling to obtain higher selectivities through extensive optimization, we wanted to
glean more information about the catalyst-ligand complex. $^1$H NMR analysis of scandium BOX
mixtures showed significant line broadening and multiple additional signals, consistent with a
poorly defined and fluxional catalyst structure. By constrast, $^1$H NMR analysis of scandium PyBOX
mixtures showed cleanly resolved signals slightly offset from the uncomplexed ligand, consistent with a well
defined monomeric catalyst species in solution. Attempts to obtain a solid state structure of
scandium BOX complexes lead to a number of bis(oxazoline) triflate salt structures
(\ce{->}\ref{cmp:xabf}, \refscheme{boxtriflatesalt}). 
 \begin{Scheme}[h]

  \caption{Formation of a triflate salt with attempts to crystallize scandium bis(oxazoline) complexes.}
  \label{sch:boxtriflatesalt}
\end{Scheme}
It is plausible that residual water on the
\ce{Sc(OTf)3}, ligand, or in the solvents, caused water to exchange for one of the triflate ligands,
producing a Br{\o}nsted acid.\footnote{{\frenchspacing Kobayashi, S.; Nagayama, S.; Busujima, T.
Lewis Acid Catalysts Stable in Water. Correlation between Catalytic Activity in Water and Hydrolysis Constants and Exchange Rate
Constants for Substitution of Inner-Sphere Water Ligands. \textit{J. Am. Chem. Soc.} \textbf{1998},
\textit{120}, 8287-8288.}} The crystal structures of scandium PyBOX complexes contain a bound
inner-sphere water which could indicate a higher Br\o nsted basicity of the BOX ligand framework.
The increased basicity serves to funnel the Br{\o}nsted acid equilibrium to \ref{cmp:xabf}. It is
also plausible the the BOX triflate salt was simply less soluble than the corresponding PyBOX triflate salt. A control
experiment with 10 mol \% \ref{cmp:xabf} indicated that it was not a competent catalyst. These data are also consistent with experiments that showed undried \ce{Sc(OTf)3} gave variable and significantly lower levels of
enantioselectivity.

  \caption{Several possibilities for the installation of a third coordinating group.}
  \label{fig:coordinationsitehypothesis}
\end{figure}
As discussed in the introduction, the PyBOX\crossref{ref:asevans} and bipyridine diol
structures\crossref{ref:askobayashistructure} from the literature revealed a 7-coordinate scandium
metal center.
Evans' well-studied scandium PyBOX catalyzed reactions all relied on a model that invoked a
two-point binding interaction between the substrate and metal, thus filling the available
coordination sites.\footnote{For a lead reference see:
{\frenchspacing Evans, D. A.; Fandrick, K. R.; Song, H. J.; Scheidt, K. A.; Xu, R. Enantioselective
Friedel-Crafts Alkylations Catalyzed by Bis(oxazolinyl)pyridine-Scandium(III) Triflate Complexes. \textit{J. Am. Chem. Soc.} \textbf{2007},
\textit{129}, 10029-10041.}} We were concerned that the BOX ligand left too much open space around
the metal center and multiple equivalents of ketone could be bound during turnover. The NMR
experiments also seemed to suggest there was a relatively weak interaction between the ligand and
scandium.  By installing another coordinating functional group in the ligand, we hypothesized that we could increase the
binding affinity for the ligand and fill more space in the coordination sphere. Our hope was that
this would force the substrate into a single binding site around the metal center and ultimately
lead to a more selective reaction. The most simple way to accomplish this would be to append the
third coordinating group to the backbone of the BOX ligand, breaking the $C_2$ symmetry.
\reffigure{coordinationsitehypothesis} illustrates several early ideas we considered. 


The first ligand we were able to access was the methyl ether substituted bis(oxazoline)
\ref{cmp:ligandam} (\refscheme{asmethyletherligand}).
Ligand \ref{cmp:ligandam} was prepared through an iterative alkylation strategy, first adding methyl
iodide and then bromoethyl methyl ether to the unsubstituted BOX framework. We were disappointed to
see a significant drop in enantioselectivity (59:41 er), but regardless, we were still motivated to
pursue alternative ligands to thoroughly test our hypothesis. The Lewis basicity of cyclohexanone and diethyl ether, as
measured by the \ce{BF3} affinity scale, are 76.36 $\pm$ 0.82 and 78.77 $\pm$ 0.38
$\frac{\mathrm{kJ}}{\mathrm{mol}}$ respectively.\footnote{Calculated from the enthalpy of
interaction between \ce{BF3}$_{\mathrm{(g)}}$ and the Lewis base. Laurence, C.; Gal, J. F.
\textit{Lewis Basicity and Affinity Scales: Data and Measurement}; John Wiley \& Sons: West Sussex,
2010; pp 85-109.} The relatively close Lewis basicities of the pendant ether functionality and
cyclohexanone could allow the cyclohexanone (present in 12 catalyst equivalents) to effectively compete for the additional coordination site.

tris(oxazoline) ligands reported by Bellemin-Laponnaz and Gade in 2002.\footnote{(a) {\frenchspacing

\ref{cmp:asaax} and \ref{cmp:asaay} were synthesized according to the reported procedures and tested
under our standard reaction conditions (\refscheme{bigtrisoxscreen}). The
indanyl TOX ligand \ref{cmp:asaax} afforded the same selectivity observed with the parent BOX
ligand \ref{cmp:ligandaa} (91:9 er). We were excited to see a
slight increase in selectivity with phenylglycine-derived TOX ligand \ref{cmp:asaay} (93:7 er).  We
also prepared several pseudo $C_3$-symmetric TOX ligands first introduced by Tang in
2002.\footnote{(a) {\frenchspacing Zhou, J.; Tang, Y. Sidearm Effect:

Recognition. \textit{Chem. Soc. Rev.} \textbf{2005}, \textit{34}, 664-676.}} The phenyl blocking
group (ligand \ref{cmp:asaaz}) delivered a 91:9 er, while the indanyl ligand \ref{cmp:ligandab}
finally gave a synthetically viable 95:5 er. We wanted to probe the effect of changing the backbone
substitution and nature of the third coordinating group within the context of the pseudo
C$_3$-symmetric ligand framework. Adding an isobutyl group to the backbone (ligand
\ref{cmp:ligandah}) afforded nearly identical selectivity (94.5:5.5 er) as ligand
\ref{cmp:ligandab}, suggesting the ligand likely binds in a tripodal fashion, placing the alkyl chain away from the site of
reaction.\footnote{For a tripodal structure of TOX bound \ce{ScCl3} (not found in the CSD search)

Without the indanyl blocking group  (ligands \ref{cmp:ligandai} and \ref{cmp:ligandaj}) selectivity
dropped.

With high levels of enantioselectivity for the model substrate now attainable using ligand
\ref{cmp:ligandab}, we started to evaluate the reaction scope with regard to cycloalkanone and
diazoalkane (\reftable{assubstrates}). Homologation of cyclobutanone with
phenyldiazomethane delivered \ref{cmp:xaam} in a lower 85.5:14.5 er (entry 1). The
product was purified through an aqueous workup and hexane extraction because of the tendency for $\alpha$-aryl cyclopentanones
to racemize on silica.\crossref{ref:asshitertiary} As anticipated, the reaction with cyclopentanone
gave a complex mixture of products derived from overhomologation (entry 2). The desired insertion product \ref{cmp:asphenylcyclohex} was
significantly more reactive than the starting
cyclopentanone.\crossref{ref:asgutscherev}$^,$\footnote{{\frenchspacing Maruoka, K.; Concepcion, A.
B.; Yamamoto, H. Selective Homologation of Ketones and Aldehydes with Diazoalkanes Promoted by
Organoaluminum Reagents. \textit{Synthesis} \textbf{1994}, 1283-1290.} \label{ref:asyamamotohomo}}
Alkyl and halogen groups on the diazoalkane were well tolerated, providing \ref{cmp:xaao} and \ref{cmp:xaap} in nearly identical
selectivity to \ref{cmp:xaan} (entries 4 and 5). We were very pleased to see that homologation of
cycloheptanone delivered products with even higher selectivity than that observed with cyclohexanone (entries
6--9). The yield in entry 9 was slightly depressed due to the lower nucleophilicity of diazoalkane
\ref{cmp:diazoad}, which caused the reaction to progress slowly and not reach full conversion even
after 14 hours.
Use of more hindered \textit{ortho}-substituted nucleophiles \ref{cmp:diazoac} and \ref{cmp:diazoaf}
resulted in diminished reactivity with TOX ligand \ref{cmp:ligandab} at the cold temperatures needed
to ensure high enantiocontrol. In these cases, however, the parent BOX ligand \ref{cmp:ligandaa} 
restored a rapid and smooth merger of the reactants presumably due to a less crowded Sc coordination
sphere (\ref{cmp:xaaq} and \ref{cmp:xaat}, 93:7 er, entries 10 and 11). The same trend was observed
when 1-naphthyldiazomethane (\ref{cmp:diazoag}) was used to prepare aryloctanone \ref{cmp:xaav}
(93:7 er, entry 12). Reaction of cyclooctanone proceeded slowly, but full conversion and a 93:7 er was
obtained after 14 hours at $-$45 \degc\  (entry 13). Depending on the ring size, the stoichiometry
was modified to maximize conversion and minimize overhomologation. For entries 3--5,
overhomologation of the cycloheptanone products had been observed in previous studies, therefore
the diazoalkane was used as the limiting reagent. A slight excess (1.2 equivalents) of
cyclohexanone was added to ensure the diazoalkane was completely consumed before having an
opportunity to react with the products. In entries 6--13, overhomologation was not a concern and an
excess of the diazoalkane was used (1.2--1.4 equivalents) to ensure high conversion. Reactions with
larger cycloalkanones and \textit{ortho}-substituted diazoalkanes proceeded slower than 6--
and 4-membered ring expansions, which lead to slight decomposition of the diazoalkane in the
reaction time frame.

The asymmetric homologation reactions could be scaled to provide preparative quantities of
enantioenriched products. We could also drop the catalyst loading to 5 mol \% and still obtain high
yields and selectivies in a reasonable timeframe by increasing the reaction concentration. After
6 hours, aryl octanone \ref{cmp:xaal} was isolated in 94\% yield (235 mg) and 97:3 er with 5 mol \%
\ce{Sc(OTf3)} and 5.5 mol \% ligand \ref{cmp:ligandab} (\refscheme{asscaleup}). Attempts to drop the
catalyst loading further resulted in incomplete conversion even after prolonged reaction times. With
2.5 mol \% \ce{Sc(OTf)3}, \ref{cmp:xaal} was recovered in a 50\% distilled yield (5 mmol scale) and
95:5 er after 22 hours.

\end{Scheme}
The absolute stereochemistry of \ref{cmp:xaan} (entry 3,
\reftable{assubstrates}) was assumed to be (\textit{S}) by comparing optical rotation data with that
reported in the asymmetric protonation literature.\footnote{The absolute stereochemistry given in
reference \ref{ref:asyanagisawa} was determined by ``analogy''.}
In order to develop a stereochemical model we needed to confirm the absolute stereochemistry of our medium ring cycloalkanones.
While \ref{cmp:xaal} was obtained as a solid, attempts to crystallize it directly
or various derivatives was largely unsuccessful. We decided to reduce \ref{cmp:xaal} and attempt an
NMR based stereoproof using $\alpha$-acetylmandelate esters
(\refscheme{asabsolutestereochem}).\footnote{{\frenchspacing Trost, B.

On the Use of the \textit{O}-Methylmandelate Ester for Establishment of Absolute Configuration of Secondary Alcohols. \textit{J. Org. Chem.} \textbf{1986}, \textit{51}, 2370-2374.}} A sample of
optically enriched \ref{cmp:xaal} ($>$95:5 er) was reduced with Red-Al in toluene at $-78$ \degc\ to
deliver the \textit{cis}-cyclooctanol \ref{cmp:xabc} in 2.5:1 dr and a 66\% isolated yield of
the major diastereomer.\footnote{Racemic material was converted to the \textit{p}-\ce{NO2} benzoate
ester and crystallized to confirm the relative stereochemistry. See the experimental section and
appendix for details.} Initial attempts to use K-selectride resulted in a more diastereoselective
reduction, but the recovered cyclooctanol was completely racemic. Coupling with (\textit{R})-- and
(\textit{S})-$\alpha$-acetylmandelic acid provided sufficient quantities of $\alpha$-acetylmandelate esters \ref{cmp:xabe} and \ref{cmp:xabd} for NMR analysis. The chemical shifts of the protons in
both diastereomers were assigned through the COSY and HSQC 2D spectra because of overlapping
resonances. The protons indicated as H$_\mathrm{a}$ are diastereotopic and careful analysis of the
spectra was required to ensure the correct signals in \ref{cmp:xabe} and \ref{cmp:xabd} were being compared.
Regardless of how the data are analyzed, the proton signals associated with the carbon bearing
H$_\mathrm{a}$ and H$_\mathrm{a'}$ show a significant upfield shift in the \textit{R} ester,
consistent with an anisotropic shielding effect from the ester conformation shown in structure \ref{cmp:xabe}. Likewise, the
proton labelled H$_\mathrm{b}$ was shielded in the \textit{S} ester \ref{cmp:xabd}. The data used to
make the determination are given in \reftable{asmandelatestereoproof}. From these data, absolute
stereochemistry for the secondary alcohol was assigned as \textit{S}, confirming that the $\alpha$-aryl stereochemistry was also \textit{S}.

Before proposing a stereochemical model, we also wanted to gather information about
the approach trajectory of the diazoalkane nucleophile. We designed a diastereoselective
homologation reaction similar to the experiment performed by Yamamoto in 1994
(\refscheme{yamamotodiastereo}, page \pageref{sch:yamamotodiastereo}).\crossref{ref:asyamamotohomo}
Treatment of 4-\textit{tert}-butylcyclohexanone with diazo \ref{cmp:diazoah} in the presence of 10
mol \% \ce{Sc(OTf)3} lead to the highly diastereoselective formation of \textit{trans} insertion
product ($\pm$)-\ref{cmp:xaay} (96.5:3.5 dr, by achiral GC analysis,
\refscheme{asdiastereoselective}).
Crystallization of the major diastereomer confirmed the \textit{trans} relative stereochemistry.
Consistent with the reported data in the literature, the observed diastereoselectivity with
stoichiometric trimethylaluminum was lower (82:18 dr).\crossref{ref:asyamamotohomo} With 10 mol \%
\ce{Sc(OTf)3} and ligand \ref{cmp:ligandab}, an enantio-- and diastereoselective reaction delivered
\ref{cmp:xaay} in 93:7 dr with 92.5:7.5 er for the major diastereomer. The diastereoselectivity can
be rationalized by invoking a model with an axial approach of the diazoalkane. The diazoalkane
likely approaches in an orientation that places the proton over the 6-membered ring to minimize
penalizing steric interactions between the aryl group and ring. The principle of least motion
states that \textit{``those elementary reactions will be favored that involve the least change in
atomic position and electronic configuration''}.\footnote{{\frenchspacing Tee, O. S. Application of
the Principle of Least Motion to Organic Reactions. A Generalized Approach. \textit{J. Am. Chem.
Soc.} \textbf{1969}, \textit{91}, 7144-7149.}} Assuming that the betaine intermediate
undergoes a least motion collapse directly from the drawn conformation and without \ce{C-C} bond
rotation, the observed diastereomer can be correctly predicted. A 120$^{\circ}$ rotation
after the diazoalkane has added would lead to the other diastereomer. However, it would introduce
significant torsional strain. Adding the other enantioface of the diazoalkane in the same orientation (Ar and N$_2$ swapped, H over ring) still predicts to the same relative stereochemistry. \begin{Scheme}[t]

  4-\textit{tert}-butylcyclohexanone.}
  \label{sch:asdiastereoselective}
\end{Scheme}

A stereochemical model to predict the absolute stereochemistry was designed based on the
aforementioned principles (\refscheme{stereochemicalmodel}). The enantioselectivity of the reaction
is most likely derived from control over the orientation with which the diazoalkane adds to
the symmetric cycloalkanone substrate. The counterions (omitted for clarity) and ligand
\ref{cmp:ligandab} establish a chiral pocket that forces the diazoalkane to enter over the open side of the ligand (from left).
The diazoalkane adds in an orientation such that the aryl group is directed away out the back of
the chiral pocket and the proton is positioned over the cycloalkanone ring. The newly formed
\ce{C-C} bond resides initially in an axial position, and then concerted collapse with expulsion of nitrogen gas delivers the \textit{S} product. This prediction was in agreement with the observed selectivity.

Chiral vicinal amino alcohols, both natural and fully synthetic, represent an exceptionally

selectivity observed for  4\ce{->}5 ring expansions was the result of more conformational
freedom of the smaller cycloalkanone within the chiral pocket. By extending the ligand blocking
groups, we hoped to minimize this flexibility and increase enantioselectivity in the arguably more

Therefore, an alternative route was developed from inexpensive 2-methylnaphthalene

The path of synthesis begins from \ref{cmp:asabc} with radical monobromination, displacement of the
crude bromide with the sodium salt of dimethyl malonate, and basic hydrolysis to afford the
homobenzylic diacid \ref{cmp:xlaab} in a 49\% yield over three steps.\footnote{{\frenchspacing An,

oligomerization.
 In
practice, we found it preferable to accomplish the transformation by the sequence:
(1) thermal decarboxylation, (2) chlorination, and (3) Friedel-Crafts ring closure
(\ref{cmp:xlaab}\ce{->}\ref{cmp:xlaad}, 78\% yield, three steps).
In just six steps requiring no purification of intermediates, ketone \ref{cmp:xlaad} can be obtained
on decagram scale in an overall 37\% yield and $>$95\% purity as judged by $^1$H NMR analysis.
Reduction and acid-mediated elimination in the same vessel provides the target hydrocarbon
3\textit{H}-benz[\textit{e}]indene (\ref{cmp:xlaae})  in an 85\% yield

by the propensity for the racemic epoxide (from \textit{m}-CPBA/\ce{NaHCO3} or DMDO) to undergo

experimentation with racemic material quickly established chiral esters of bromohydrin
\ref{cmp:xlaaf} as highly crystalline. Thus, indene oxidation with NBS in THF-water (99\% yield)
and coupling with (\textit{S})-naproxen under standard conditions gave a mixture of diasteromeric
esters from which (--)-\ref{cmp:xlaag} crystallized in a 34\% yield as a single diastereomer.
Naproxen was selected as a resolving agent because of the trivial means by which multigram quantities of
 enantiopure material can be obtained from over-the-counter pain relief tablets. The absolute
 configuration of (--)-\ref{cmp:xlaag} was unequivocally assigned by X-ray diffraction (\reffigure{asnaproxenxray}).

 Among several different hydrolytic conditions tested, cleavage
of the resolving agent was best achieved by borane reduction to give the desired
(\textit{R},\textit{R}) bromohydrin \ref{cmp:xlaal} in a 91\% yield with $>$98:2 er by chiral SFC
analysis. The choice of reductive cleavage necessitated the only chromatographic
purification in the entire sequence. While hydrolytic cleavage would have been preferrable,
competitive bromide elimination was prohibitive. Attempts to move unpurified \ref{cmp:xlaal} forward
were not successful. The purified bromohydrin was then subjected to a Ritter
reaction\footnote{{\frenchspacing Davies, I.

The modest yield was accounted for by the recovery of \textit{cis}-acetamide \ref{cmp:xlaah} (in a
$>$2:1 ratio in favor of amino alcohol \ref{cmp:xlaai}).  The byproduct likely forms as a result of
non-stereospecific trapping of the benzylic cation by acetonitrile and subsequent failure to undergo
intramolecular closure to the intermediate oxazoline (\refscheme{asrittermechanism}). The added
stability gained by transient bromonium ion formation, a key feature for stereocontrol in this
reaction, was offset by enhanced delocalization of the cation within the naphthalene ring.
Co-production of acetamide \ref{cmp:xlaah}, together with the aforementioned facile rearrangement of
epoxy-\ref{cmp:xlaae},\crossref{ref:asepoxiderar} lends support to this hypothesis. Noteworthy is
that acetamide hydrolysis does not occur in the absence of the vicinal hydroxyl functionality.\footnote{{\frenchspacing Bruice, T. C.; Marquardt, F. H. Hydroxyl Group Catalysis.

Our experience with the synthesis of bis(oxazolinyl)methanes had shown that the diethoxyimidate
method of Davies \textit{et al.}\crossref{ref:asdaviesdielsalder}$^\mathrm{a}$ allows expedient
access to the unsubstituted BOX framework.
Coupling of amino alcohol \ref{cmp:xlaai} with commercially available diethyl malonimidate
dihydrochloride furnishes BOX ligand \ref{cmp:xlaaj} in 63\% yield as a white flocculent solid
after washing with hexanes and
methanol (\refscheme{astlligandtwo}). Deprotonation with sodium hydride and subsequent trapping with
methyl iodide lead to the target \textit{gem}-dimethylated ligand \ref{cmp:xlaak} in a 92\% yield
after a hexanes wash.

  \label{fig:astlcopperbox}
\end{figure}
We were eager to test the newly prepared BOX ligand \ref{cmp:xlaak} in our asymmetric homologation
chemistry. The new ligand was sparingly soluble in toluene and in all homologation cases tested,
racemic products were obtained. The ligand was likely unable to complex with scandium because of the
poor solubility in toluene, however, when we tested the same reactions in \ce{CH2Cl2}, racemic
products were again obtained. For further proof of structure and to confirm that \ref{cmp:xlaak}
could act as a viable chiral ligand, we turned to copper(II) salts. Suitable single crystals of
\ce{CuCl2.}\ref{cmp:xlaak} were obtained by vapor diffusion of pentane into a saturated
dichloromethane solution. X-ray diffraction revealed a four-coordinate
distorted square planar 17-electron complex flanked by sizeable naphthalene units
(\reffigure{astlcopperbox}).
Importantly, there was considerable homology between this structure and the analogous
\ce{CuCl2.}(indanyl-box) catalyst with regard to the disposition of groups around the
copper(II) center.\footnote{{\frenchspacing Thorhauge, J.; Roberson, M.; Hazell, R. G.; J\o rgensen,

\textit{8}, 1888-1898.}} While \ref{cmp:xlaak} appears to form a competent complex with
copper(II), whether or not the extended blocking groups translate into higher levels of selectivity
in asymmetric reactions remains to be seen.


\subsection{Development of a Fluorine NMR Titration Protocol}
During the course of our studies, we required a rapid and accurate
method to assay the active diazoalkane concentration in toluene stock solutions.
Although a number of methods have been reported in the literature, none offered
a simple procedure that could be executed quickly and with small quantities of
the diazoalkane reagent. Those based on acid-mediated decomposition and collection
of evolved nitrogen gas require large quantities of the diazoalkane and
elaborate experimental setups.\crossref{ref:asbrewer} Spectrophotometric methods require
preparation of calibration standards and calculation of extinction coefficients
for compounds that can readily decompose at room temperature or by light-induced
pathways.\footnote{{\frenchspacing Gassman, P. G.; Greenlee, W. J. Dideuteriodiazomethane.
\textit{Org. Synth.} \textbf{1973}, \textit{53}, 38.}} Esterification with excess benzoic acid and titration of the unreacted carboxylic acid is time-consuming, requiring preparation and
calibration of stock base solutions in order to obtain accurate
results.\footnote{{\frenchspacing Arndt, F. Diazomethane. \textit{Org. Synth.} \textbf{1935},
\textit{15}, 3.}} Esterification with benzoic acid and calculation of concentration on the basis of the unpurified yield of the benzoate ester is also
possible, but at times will provide concentration results of questionable
accuracy due to common diazoalkane impurities.\footnote{Bimolecular decomposition pathways to
produce azine or olefin impurities are common for noncarbonylstabilized diazoalkanes. (a)
{\frenchspacing Overberger, C. G.; Anselme, J. The Thermal and the Photolytic Decomposition of
1-Phenyldiazoethane. \textit{J. Org. Chem.} \textbf{1964}, \textit{29}, 1188-1190.} (b)

Previously, our preferred method involved quenching a known volume of the
diazoalkane solution with excess benzoic acid and isolating the corresponding
benzoate ester by chromatography. The isolated yield of the
benzoate ester could then be used to calculate the amount of active diazoalkane
in the aliquot. This method was not only time intensive, but inherently flawed.
Assuming the diazoalkane quantitatively converted to the benzoate ester, the
method was still subject to mechanical losses during purification and transfer
steps.\footnote{{\frenchspacing Wernerova, M.; Hudlicky, T. On the Practical Limits of Determining
Isolated Product Yields and Ratios of Stereoisomers: Reflections, Analysis, and Redemption.
\textit{Synlett} \textbf{2010}, 2701-2707.}} A new method, using commercially available 2-fluorobenzoic acid and quantitative $^{19}$F NMR spectroscopy was developed to address some of these shortcomings.\footnote{\frenchspacing{﻿Rendina, V. L.; Kingsbury, J. S. Titration of Nonstabilized Diazoalkane
Solutions by Fluorine NMR. \textit{J. Org. Chem.} \textbf{2012}, \textit{77},
1181-1185.}} The new protocol required minimal experimental time and could be performed safely at
low temperature with only micromolar quantities of the diazoalkane.

In a typical experimental procedure, an accurately weighed quantity of excess
2-fluoro\-benzoic acid was dissolved in 700 $\mu$L of \ce{CDCl3},\footnote{It was found that
2-fluorobenzoic acid dissolved slowly in \ce{CDCl3}, and preparation of a stock solution was
generally more convenient. See the experimental section for details.} enough solvent to prepare a
single NMR sample.
After cooling to $-$78 \degc, which causes the solution to freeze, a 100 $\mu$L aliquot of the
diazoalkane solution was added rapidly in a single portion.\footnote{A 1.00 mL syringe with calibration marks every 0.01 mL used.
The procedure was sufficiently reproducible with this size syringe; howevery, if more accurate
results were desired a 250 $\mu$L syringe was substituted.} Upon warming of the mixture to room
temperature, the reaction was complete as indicated by the absence of the characteristic diazoalkane
color and lack of further nitrogen gas evolution. The reaction mixture was swirled gently to ensure
homogeneity and then transferred without rinsing to a standard NMR tube for analysis. The $^{19}$F
NMR data were recorded with an extended relaxation delay of 10 seconds (d1 = 10). The fluorine $T_1$
values for 2-fluorobenzoic acid and benzyl 2-fluorobenzoate were determined to be 1.14 $\pm$ 0.03
and 1.73 $\pm$ 0.06 seconds respectively. Relaxation delays of 10 seconds were sufficiently long
($>$5 x $T_1$) to ensure integral accuracies of $\pm$1\%.\footnote{{\frenchspacing Saito, T.;
Nakaie, S.; Kinoshita, M.; Ihara, T.; Kinugasa, S.; Nomura, A.; Maeda, T. Practical Guide for Accurate
Quantitative Solution State NMR Analysis. \textit{Metrologia} \textbf{2004}, \textit{41}, 213-218.}} The difference in $^{19}$F NMR chemical shift between the unreacted 2-fluorobenzoic acid and 2-fluorobenzoate esters was approximately 1.0 ppm. The spectra were referenced relative to hexafluorobenzene ($\delta$ $-$164.9 ppm) as an internal standard; however, the use
of a reference standard was not necessary due to the uniform upfield shift of the esters.
Conversion, and ultimately concentration, was calculated on the basis of integration of the two
fluorine signals (Equation \ref{eq:diazoconc}).
\begin{eqnarray}
I_{\mathrm{ester}} &=& \mathrm{integration\  of\  ester} \\
I_{\mathrm{acid}} &=& \mathrm{integration\  of\  acid} \\
m_{\mathrm{acid}} &=& \mathrm{amount\ of\  acid\ (mmol)} \\
V_{\mathrm{aliquot}} &=& \mathrm{volume\ of\ aliquot\ (mL)} \\

I_{\mathrm{acid}}} \right) \times m_{\mathrm{acid}}}{V_{\mathrm{aliquot}}} \label{eq:diazoconc}
\end{eqnarray}
\vspace{-25pt}

\reftable{astitration} summarizes our findings for titration of various alkyl, aryl, and vinyl
diazoalkane solutions. In every case, the reaction quickly and cleanly produced the corresponding
2-fluorobenzoate esters.  Noteworthy of the assay is its high reproducibility. Data in
\reftable{astitration} are reported as the average of three trials $\pm$ standard deviations. Prior to the discovery of 2-fluorobenzoic acid, attempts were made to use $^1$H NMR spectroscopy with several substituted benzoic acid derivatives. Although the use of 2,6-dimethoxybenzoic acid was successful in certain cases, it did not
prove to be a general solution because of problems with overlapping resonances.
Recourse to $^{19}$F NMR spectroscopy has avoided this complication in all cases
tested thus far.

\end{table}

Results for esterification with benzoic acid and weighing of the unpurified benzoate ester after a
basic aqueous workup are also provided in \reftable{astitration} for comparison. With the exception of
methyl benzoate (entry 1), isolation of the benzoate esters leads to concentration values that
exceed those obtained with the new procedure. The volatility of methyl benzoate was likely responsible for
the lower value obtained in entry 1. Certain diazoalkanes can undergo decomposition upon prolonged
storage or warming, and nonvolatile impurities can be introduced during preparative
procedures.\crossref{ref:asdiazodecomp} Either of these complications can account for the higher
concentration values observed with the gravimetric benzoylation method. The new titration procedure
does not require isolation of the esters and was not affected by the presence of typical impurities.

The accuracy of this method, and all methods based on esterification, rely on
quantitative conversion of the diazoalkanes to their corresponding
esters. The concentration of unreacted phenyldiazomethane (\ref{cmp:diazoaa}) was quickly analyzed
in triplicate by $^1$H NMR spectroscopy with 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene as an internal standard. The
concentration was determined to be 1.25 $\pm$ 0.02 M by this method, in reasonable agreement with
the value in \reftable{astitration} (entry 4). In certain cases, diazonium ions formed after the initial protonation event can undergo spontaneous rearrangement or elimination, ultimately leading to byproducts that would not be observed by $^{19}$F NMR spectroscopy.\footnote{{\frenchspacing Curtin, D. Y.; Gerber, S. M. The Reaction of Aliphatic Diazo Compounds with Acids. \textit{J. Am. Chem. Soc.} \textbf{1952}, \textit{74},

acid, rapid rearrangement to the tertiary carbocation occured affording predominantly ester
\ref{cmp:xtabg} and two elimination byproducts (\refscheme{astitrationpiv}). The expected ester
\ref{cmp:xtabf}, resulting from direct substitution, only accounted for 10\% of the product
distribution.
For diazoalkanes that undergo elimination, the use of $^{19}$F NMR spectroscopy alone does not provide accurate concentration values.
The concentration of \ref{cmp:diazoan} could still be determined from the combined $^1$H and
$^{19}$F NMR data, although likely not with the same level of accuracy and
precision as diazoalkanes which cleanly afford a single ester product.

\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, this chapter has described a number of projects, not solely limited to
diazoalkane ring expansion chemistry. Advances were first made in the procedures for racemic
\ce{Sc(OTf)3}-catalyzed homologation reactions. By carefully purifying and drying all reaction
components, catalyst loadings as low as 0.5 mol \% were readily tolerated and reactions
consistently afforded high chemical yields. With a conscientious and rigorous approach to reaction
development, the first examples of catalytic asymmetric diazoalkane ring expansions were
demonstrated. High enantioselectivities in the context of $\alpha$-aryl medium-ring cycloalkanones
were observed. The lower selectivities with smaller cycloalkanones prompted the development of a
new $\pi$-extended amino alcohol and the corresponding bis(oxazoline) ligands. A scalable and
inexpensive route was designed and provided the new amino alcohol in 4 steps from known compounds
with one chromatography step.
Finally, the need for a safe and convenient means to assay diazoalkane solution concentrations lead to the development of a quantitative $^{19}$F NMR titration protocol.

Future work in this area will certainly focus on extending the substrate scope of asymmetric
homologation reactions. We have taken the first steps towards developing a unified method for the
construction of $\alpha$-keto stereogenic centers. By modifying the diazoalkane nucleophile, access
to $\alpha$-aryl, --vinyl, and --alkyl all-carbon quaternary stereogenic centers could be within
reach. The stigma and hazards of handling diazoalkane reagents may hamper future efforts, and
research should concentrate on finding suitable methods to generate the diazoalkanes \textit{in situ}. Without the
need to prepare or store the hazardous diazoalkane reagents, this chemistry could find much broader
appeal among the chemical community. The fact that the reaction rapidly builds significant molecular
complexity in a single convergent step justifies its further development.
