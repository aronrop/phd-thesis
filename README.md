This open source copy of my doctoral thesis was written entirely using LaTex. The generated PDF file is available for download as [thesis.pdf](https://github.com/vrendina/phd-thesis/blob/master/thesis.pdf). Chemical structures were drawn using ChemDraw and exported to EPS format. All compound numbering was generated automatically using LaTex and overlaid directly on the graphics.
