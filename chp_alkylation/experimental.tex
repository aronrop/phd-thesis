\textit{Representative procedure for etherification of secondary alcohols
catalyzed by imidazolium salts:} \\ \textbf{\CMPxcaa}\ (\ref{cmp:xcaa}).
In a dry box, NaOtBu (21.1 mg, 0.220 mmol, 1.10 equiv) and imidazolium salt \ref{cmp:xcag} (8.0 mg,
0.020 mmol, 10 mol \%) were combined in a 1 dram (3.7 mL) vial. The mixture of solids was moved to
a nitrogen manifold and toluene (2 mL) was added, forming a white suspension. Benzyl bromide (36
$\mu$L, 0.30 mmol, 1.5 equiv) was added followed by 1-phenylethanol (24 $\mu$L, 0.20 mmol, 1.0
equiv). The reaction mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature for 2 hours and then quenched
by addition of \ce{Et2O} (1 mL) containing an accurately weighed quantity of
1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene.\footnote{A stock solution containing an accurately weighed quantity of
1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene in \ce{Et2O} was freshly prepared prior to workup. The stock solutions
typically contained 10.0-15.0 mg of 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene per mL.} The reaction contents were
transferred to a 16 x 125 mm test tube containing saturated aqueous \ce{NH4Cl} (2 mL) and vigorously
stirred for 15 seconds. An aliquot of the upper organic layer was withdrawn and $^1$H NMR data were
obtained with a relaxation delay time of 10 seconds (d1 = 10). Integration of the internal standard
and product peaks indicated a yield of 0.16 mmol, 82\%. The highest yield obtained with imidazolium
salt \ref{cmp:xcag} was 0.18 mmol, 89\%. An analytically pure sample for comparison purposes was
obtained by purification on silica gel (5\% ethyl acetate in hexanes v/v) to afford a colorless oil.\\

\noindent \textbf{\CMPxcanb}\ (\ref{cmp:xcanb}). In a microwave vessel, imidazole \ref{cmp:xcana}
(41.5 mg, 0.300 mmol, 1.00 equiv), DIPEA (78.4 $\mu$L, 0.450 mmol, 1.50 equiv), and benzyl chloride (173
$\mu$L, 1.50 mmol, 5.00 equiv) were dissolved in \ce{CH3CN} (1.5 mL). The reaction
mixture was microwaved at 180 \degc\ for 5 minutes then rapidly cooled to room temperature. The
solvent was removed \textit{in vacuo} and resulting dark brown oil was dissolved in 50 mL of
saturated aqueous \ce{K2CO3}. The aqueous solution was washed with \ce{Et2O} (2 x 25 mL),
discarding the organic washes. The product was extracted with \ce{CH2Cl2} (3 x 75 mL), dried over
\ce{MgSO4}, filtered, and concentrated to afford \ref{cmp:xcanb} as a white solid (36.2 mg,
34.0\%), mp 138-140 \degc.\\
